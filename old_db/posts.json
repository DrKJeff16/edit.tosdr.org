It is\nquite complex to rate them, as these ToS govern all google\nservices, but contradictory clauses may supersede them in specific\nservices.\n\nAll in all, if you add up all points to Google, you still reach a\nnegative result. Hence, Google will probably rank class C (defined\nas  “The terms of service are okay but some issues need your\nconsideration.” here http://tosdr.org/classification.html )\n\nInteresting enough, some of our points are pointed out by data\nprotection authority as not compliant with the current European\nregulation\nhttp://www.cnil.fr/english/news-and-events/news/article/googles-new-privacy-policy-incomplete-information-and-uncontrolled-combination-of-data-across-ser/\n\nWhat do you think?

We may\n    add or remove functionalities or features, and we may suspend\n    or stop a Service altogether.\n\n    You can stop using our Services at any time, although we’ll be\n    sorry to see you go. Google may also stop providing Services to\n    you, or add or create new limits to our Services at any time.\n\n    We believe that you own your data and preserving your access to\n    such data is important. If we discontinue a Service, where\n    reasonably possible, we will give you reasonable advance notice\n    and a chance to get information out of that Service. \n\nSo we have to distinguish two cases:\n\n - Google stops a service to all users\n    (Read: https://groups.google.com/d/topic/tosdr/PD5ZWzgv2RI/discussion )\n\n - Google stops a service to you\n\nThe \"reasonable advance notice\" only applies to the first case,\nnot the latter. So without further details from the terms, it's\nfair to draw the conclusion that Google can stop providing a\nservice to you at any time, without giving you a reason or\nanything. At least, they don't say that they can stop providing a\nservice \"for no reason\" or \"for any reason\" but to be completely\nsilent about it might not make things easy for the user.\n\nThis looks similar to Github and Netflix (but not exactly the\nsame)\n\n  - https://groups.google.com/d/topic/tosdr/hI5Too_uDVk/discussion\n  - https://groups.google.com/d/topic/tosdr/L5pl0Vn9lKY/discussion\n\nSo I propose to sum it up like this:\n\nGoogle may stop providing services to you at any time\n\n“Google may also stop providing Services to you, or add or create\nnew limits to our Services at any time.” Google has no obligation\nfrom the terms to give you notice in advance or to give a reason\nfor that termination.\n\ntopic: http://tosdr.org/topics.html#suspension\nscore: 40\npoint: mediocre\n\n\n-- \nHugo Roy, Project Lead\nTerms of Service; Didn't Read | www.tosdr.org\n\n\n-- \nHugo Roy, Project Lead\nTerms of Service; Didn't Read | www.tosdr.org\n\n-- \ntosdr.org | twitter.com/tosdr | github.com/tosdr\n--- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups \"Terms of Service; Didn't Read\" group.\nTo unsubscribe from this group and stop receiving emails from it, send an email to tosdr+unsubscribe@googlegroups.com.\nTo post to this group, send email to tosdr@googlegroups.com.\nVisit this group at http://groups.google.com/group/tosdr?hl=en.\nFor more options, visit https://groups.google.com/groups/opt_out.\n\n\n"},

Every section is kept small and understandable. The terms though are presented in English and not the users language. The service itself is presented in multiple languages, this appears to be crowd translated which would explain the terms not being subject to translation.\n\n\nTerms can be changed at any time but users will be informed about this (Section 3)\n\n\nYou are free to delete your account (Section 21)\n\n\nExtracting data (Not specifically noted in any section)\nThough the service currently is Cloud storage and some user to user messaging they plan to expand into VoIP and email soon. Files can easily be extracted but there is so far as I can tell no means of extracting things like contact lists and messages. I will contact Mega regarding such extraction for clarification.\n\n\nData stored on the service is encrypted using keys held by the user so Mega has no access to them. Though there is no anonymity it is a private service. They will also by their own public admission (twitter - no citation links presently) not make any effort to prevent users from since TOR or other anonymity technologies when accessing the service. \n\n\nThey have a well documented process in place to handle DMCA and other copyright violations. Since Mega has no knowledge of the files stored, this is only applicable in cases where a user has publicly shared a file. They also make the user aware that doing so negates the privacy of that file for anyone in possession of the link. They also have a process for filing a counter claim to any such request (Section 19 and 20).\nOne presumes that being in possession of any such shared file(s) which has been the subject of a valid DMCA or other copyright takedown would be reasonable grounds to compel a user to provide decryption keys under the law in many countries which is probably reasonable and at any rate not something Mega can put conditions for in their ToS. They could though put such notices in their service like they do to explain the loss of privacy when sharing a link.\n\n\n\nThey remind you that the password should be strong and held securely as if it is lost there is no means of recovery and it is the provider of security for your data (Section 18)\n\n\nI believe these are A class terms, with bonus points for an excellent easy to read presentation.\n\n\n\nTerms of Service - https://mega.co.nz/#terms\n\nPrivacy policy - https://mega.co.nz/#privacy\n\n\n == rdio.com - rdio - streaming music service ==\n\n\nThis is a traditional legalese Terms of Service agreement with long sections and unclear separation. They do however get points for presenting it in the users language.\n\n\nTerms can be changed at any time and you will not be informed of such changes. It is the users responsibility to constantly stay aware of the terms of service and continued use as changes are published is considered accepting changes (Section 19)\n\n\nYou grant rdio and its associated companies rights to any content you upload. They may also use and publish your name in conjunction with any such content (Section 10)\n\n\nUsers can have access terminated at any time if Rdio judges that the ToS have been violated, have gotten a request regarding such a violation (one assumes copyright or DMCA request) or your use of the service is deemed “unsuitable” or “unacceptable”  (neither term defined so basically this must mean.. if they feel like it). (Section 16)\n\n\nIf you are in a region where rdio sells downloadable music, this content is DRM free and in the common mp3 format. Such files are, potentially, watermarked and such information is stored in the file. If the service is terminated this content will remain usable (Section 3.2)\n\n\nThere are no provisions of having an account terminated and deleted permanently from the service, nor for extracting data so far as I can tell.\n\n\nThere isn’t much nice stuff to say about rdio’s terms, they are likely in Class D or E.\n\n\nTerms of Service - http://www.rdio.com/legal/terms-of-service/\n\n\nKind regards,\nDavid Nielsen\n\n\nThank you for the service, it really does I hope make terms of service a little easier to figure out for regular users.\n\n\nSent with Unibox\n\n\n-- \ntosdr.org | twitter.com/tosdr | github.com/tosdr\n--- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups \"Terms of Service; Didn't Read\" group.\nTo unsubscribe from this group and stop receiving emails from it, send an email to tosdr+unsubscribe@googlegroups.com.\nTo post to this group, send email to tosdr@googlegroups.com.\nVisit this group at http://groups.google.com/group/tosdr.\nFor more options, visit https://groups.google.com/groups/opt_out.\n"},

I'm not sure how common that is among \ncarriers, but it should be industry standard.\n\nHow to handle* fees inside a ToS* is tricky. If they're hiding activation \nfees in the terms that you don't know about until you get your bill, then I \nthink ToS;DR should put some sort of \"Fees hidden in ToS\" warning. If \nthey're up front about things like activation fees and show it in your \ntotal as you check out with a new phone plan then I don't see any reason \nToS;DR should include them.\n\nAbout being *on the hook for a stolen phone* - I thought about the ideal \nscenario here, and the 'best' solution I could come up with is removing any \noverage charges after the date/time that you say the phone was stolen in a \nfiled police report because it is perjury to lie in a police report. The \nnext best solution I could come up with is the way they do it, which is to \nremove overage charges from the time you call them.

Since then, Twitter now has the same kind of terms\nthan Twitpic, and Twitter now hosts pictures themselves. As stated in\ntwitter.com/tos pictures are part of the \"Content\" subject to the broad\ncopyright license.\n\n\nMay 26, 2011, 6:32 pm\nIf Twitpic’s New Deal Troubles You, Here Are Some Options\nBy PAUL BOUTIN\n\nWord got out this week that Twitpic, the most popular service used by\nTwitter users to upload and post photos, had struck an exclusive\npartnership with World Entertainment News Network, a news and photo\nagency that specializes in celebrity stories and pictures.\n\nThe deal allows the agency to sell images posted on Twitpic for\npublication elsewhere. (Flickr, by contrast, expressly forbids the reuse\nof its members' photos without their personal permission or a special\ncopyright designation that allows commercial use.)\n\nTwitter users went ballistic, especially professional photographers,\nbecause the deal effectively turned Twitpic's 20 million registered\nusers into a free photo pool from which someone else could potentially\nmake money for hot shots like Janis Krums' 2009 picture of Flight 1549\nlanding on the Hudson River, or Stefanie Gordon's recent photo (shown)\ntaken from her airplane seat, of the space shuttle Endeavor lifting off\nthrough the clouds. Ms. Gordon told MSNBC that five news agencies had\npaid her for use of her photo, which has been seen by millions, but many\nmore publishers had not.\n\nWorld Entertainment News Network's chief executive said he was only\ninterested in photos posted by celebrity Twitter users, which is\nW.E.N.N.'s specialty. But a brief statement from Twitpic dodged the\nW.E.N.N. issue, stating only that Twitpic would clamp down on\nunauthorized use of members' photos. \"You allow us to distribute that\ncontent on twitpic.com and our affiliated partners,\" the post reminded\nusers.\n\nTo be fair, your text messages are equally republishable by Twitter, as\nstated in that company's nearly identical legalese. But some people feel\ndifferently about their pictures.\n\nThe opportunity to have a hastily snapped photo become world-famous is\nmore appealing to many Twitter users than the need to get paid for it,\nor to control its publication. But if Twitpic's terms of service bug\nyou, there's a quick fix: Change the settings on your Twitter mobile app\nto switch the photo upload service from Twitpic to yfrog, the other\nbuilt-in option.\n\nThe terms of service of Yfrog, which is made by ImageShack, are pretty\nblunt: \"ImageShack will not sell or distribute your content to third\nparties or affiliates without your permission. Third parties may\nhyperlink to the page that displays your content on the ImageShack\nNetwork without modification and with proper attribution to you. Third\nparties may request permission to use your content by contacting you\ndirectly. All requests for permission regarding your content usage\ndirected at ImageShack will be forwarded to you.\" So it seems unlikely\nthat pictures uploaded to yfrog will end up in, say, a TMZ story without\nyou getting a shot at royalties.\n\nShould you delete your photos from Twitpic? Take a cue from the talk\nshow host Ellen Degeneres. In response to W.E.N.N.'s deal with Twitpic,\nshe stopped using Twitpic in her Twitter messages a couple of weeks ago.\nShe now posts photos to her own ellen.tv site. But she hasn't bothered\nto go back and move all of her old pictures off of Twitpic. That makes\nsense, because it's unlikely that World Entertainment News Network will\ngo data-mining Twitpic archives for old photos. What they want are the\nlatest snapshots of what's happening and who's hot right now, for which\nTwitter is the best medium ever. That picture of the space shuttle?

And I hope that my comments will be useful too. \nOne thing what we should not forget about Terms of Service is that actually \nthere are questions, when you do not obligatory have to put information for \ncustomers on \"Transparency on law enforcement requests\". Why? Because the \nlaw enforcement requests are regulated by the legislation of the respected \ncountry, where you receive the services. And not only country - even \nregion. For example, in European Union - there is one interesting legal \nact, which is the Data Retention Directive. Here will be a \nshort description from Wikipedia(\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Retention_Directive) and here is a link \nto the legal act itself (\nhttp://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2006:105:0054:0063:EN:PDF\n): \nThe *Data Retention Directive*, more formally \"Directive 2006/24/EC of the \nEuropean Parliament and of the Council of 15 March 2006 on the retention of \ndata generated or processed in connection with the provision of publicly \navailable electronic communications services or of public communications \nnetworks and amending Directive 2002/58/EC\" is a Directive<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union_directive> issued \nby the European Union <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union> and \nrelates to Telecommunications data retention<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications_data_retention>. \nAccording to the directive, member states will have to store citizens' \ntelecommunications data for six to 24 months stipulating a maximum time \nperiod. Under the directive the police and security agencies will be able \nto request access to details such as IP address and time of use of every \nemail, phone call and text message sent or received. A permission to access \nthe information will be granted only by a court.\nSo, what does it mean? The Directive has to be transposed to the national \nlegislation of every country of the European Union, basically part or all \nof the provisions have to be included in the legal acts of \nthe corresponding topic.\nIn this case, the mentioning of this Directive or it's provisions does not \nhave to be done it ToS as it is by law. I am not \" a devil's advocate\", but \nit is a reality.\nUnfortunately, I did not have time to google more on the subject of not \nEuropean Union cases, so I don't have enough info about US or other \ncountries.

In fact, we have made a number of changes that are designed\n  to clarify these Laws and to provide additional information for our\nusers to enable them to understand how to protect their data and how we\n  collect and handle your data and personal information. These are the\n           significant changes we want to highlight for you:\n                                    \n                             Easier to Read\n                                    \nThe first thing individuals will notice when reviewing our new Terms of\n  Service and Privacy Policy is that they are more conversational with\n   less legal jargon. We hope that the updated description of how we\n  operate the Evernote Service and the respective commitments between\n     Evernote and our users are much easier to read and understand.\n                                    \n                            A Global Company\n                                    \n As part of our effort to better support the needs of our users around\n the world, we have established a company based in Zurich, Switzerland\ncalled Evernote GmbH. This wholly-owned subsidiary will be managing our\n business and the Evernote Service for our users who reside outside of\n the United States and Canada, and will be contracting with those users\n   under Swiss law. The Evernote Service and all of its servers will\n continue to be operated by the California-based Evernote Corporation.\n For our users in the European Economic Area, this means that Evernote\n       GmbH is the data controller for data protection purposes.\n                                    \n                    Preparing for Evernote Business\n                                    \nAs we announced at the Evernote Trunk Conference in August, we will soon\nbe launching Evernote Business. We have updated our Terms of Service to\n   reflect how existing Evernote Service accounts will co-exist with\n Evernote Business. Existing Evernote users who are invited to join an\nEvernote Business account will find that their existing account gains a\n  number of enhancements, most notably the ability to access and share\nnotebooks with others in that business. Evernote Business accounts will\n be managed by an Administrator who has rights to allow or restrict an\n      individual user’s access to the business’ notebooks, but the\nAdministrator is not provided any information about any user’s personal\n    Evernote account. (We will not even tell an Administrator if an\n individual user’s account exists.) Nor can the content in an Evernote\n    personal account be accessed, viewed or otherwise affected by an\n                             Administrator.\n                                    \n                          Evernote in Schools\n                                    \n We’re thrilled with the number of educators and administrators around\nthe world who have shown interest in using Evernote in their schools, so\n     we have modified our contracts with respect to use by underage\n  individuals who might not be old enough to enter into a contract on\n their own, including specific guidance for schools in the US where we\n want to ensure that the requirements of the Children’s Online Privacy\n                     Protection Act are satisfied.\n                                    \n                        Planning for the Future\n                                    \n   We have established a policy not to disclose our users’ content to\n others, even next of kin, after a user’s death or incapacity. We have\n  included this within our Terms of Service and encourage our users to\ndecide whether their content should be available to others, and plan for\nthis eventuality. We have also provided more guidance on the process by\n  which user accounts are closed and how users can delete content from\n                            their accounts.\n                                    \n                         Resolution of Disputes\n                                    \n     We have revamped our dispute resolution process by introducing\n arbitration provisions that will enable users throughout the world to\nresolve disputes they may have with Evernote more expeditiously and less\n                              expensively.\n                                    \n    Using arbitration to resolve claims means that users will not be\n  required to travel to California (or Switzerland, for Evernote GmbH\n users) to file a lawsuit and appear in court and, if the amount of the\nclaim is less than US$10,000, the arbitration may even be done over the\n  phone or internet, depending upon the circumstances. In an effort to\n resolve all disputes promptly, we are also including a provision that\n  requires both parties to use good faith to initiate the arbitration\n    proceeding within 30 days, with a mutually acceptable arbitrator\n                         managing the process.\n                                    \n Our changes will provide users outside the US an option to have their\ndispute resolved through arbitration, but under a special US law, we are\n requiring users in the US to use binding arbitration as the exclusive\n   means for resolving disputes and to agree that such claims will be\n resolved only between them and Evernote (prohibiting participation in\n           class actions or similar representative actions).\n                                    \nWe feel strongly that requiring arbitration of disputes on an individual\n    basis will enhance our ability to work with our users to resolve\n disputes, while ensuring that an individual user maintains control of\nthe issue raised and resolution desired – and that this will happen much\n  more quickly than the long months or years that class action matters\n  typically require. Because we are requiring arbitration for US users\n(and others subject to the US Federal Arbitration Act), we will pay the\n  arbitration-related fees for all claims up to US$10,000 and even in\ncases involving more than that amount if those fees would be prohibitive\ncompared to litigation costs, unless, in either case, the claim asserted\nis determined by the arbitrator to be frivolous. We appreciate that this\n is a significant change, so we will permit existing Evernote users who\ndo not agree with this change to “opt-out” of the arbitration agreement\nby notifying us via the methods described in our Terms within 30 days of\n        December 4, 2012 (the effective date of our new Terms).\n                                    \n                         Please Read Everything\n                                    \nWe strongly encourage everyone to read our new contract terms carefully,\n in their entirety. The content placed into Evernote is important, and\nall of our users should feel completely comfortable entrusting it to the\nService. This post does not describe all of the changes to the Terms of\nService and Privacy Policy and is not, after all, our contract with our\n users.

In the context of a privacy policy like this one, since you\nalready consent to use Google's services and to upload some data\nand to allow them to collect some data, it seems that by default\nyou consent to the sharing of non-sensitive personal information.\n\nWhat do others think?\n\nI propose to reduce our point to information that can be shared\nwithout requiring subsequent \"opt-in\" consent and so to sum it up\nlike this:\n\n    Google can share personal information and aggregated\n    non-personal information with other parties\n\nGoogle will share your personal information with other parties.\nFor sensitive information (medical, racial, ethnic, political,\nreligious or sexuality) Google requires “opt-in”.

Hopefully this discussion could help us draw a\nline between what's merely a practice not really fair for the user, and\nwhat's really unacceptable.\n\nHave a look at http://tos-dr.info/topics.html#suspension\n\nWe have\n        50 Steam: Valve can cancel your account at any time.   \n        \n        Section 10:C “Valve may cancel your Account or any particular\n        Subscription(s) at any time. In the event that your Account or a\n        particular Subscription is terminated or cancelled by Valve for\n        a violation of this Agreement or improper or illegal activity,\n        no refund, including of any Subscription fees, will be granted.”\n        \nand, we have\n        130 Github: Your account can be suspended and your data deleted\n        any time   \n        \n        “GitHub, in its sole discretion, has the right to suspend or\n        terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future\n        use of the Service, or any other GitHub service, for any reason\n        at any time. Such termination of the Service will result in the\n        deactivation or deletion of your Account or your access to your\n        Account, and the forfeiture and relinquishment of all Content in\n        your Account. GitHub reserves the right to refuse service to\n        anyone for any reason at any time. ”\n        \nSo far, I see two important differences:\n      * Github's for *any reason* while Steam does not state so (does it\n        elsewhere?). This leads us to ask a question: what does it mean\n        for Steam? If they cancel your account for unvalid reason: what\n        can the user do?\n      * Github can delete your data, while Steam merely is about\n        cancelling the account. It was pointed out that GitHub is based\n        on Git which is distributed, so no important data would be lost.\n        But I disagree with this, as GitHub is way larger than just a\n        git repo hosting.\n-- \nHugo Roy \n  French Coordinator, FSFE       chat: hugo@jabber.fsfe.org\n  www.fsfe.org/about/roy         mobile: +336 08 74 13 41\n                                 mobile DE: +49 151 143 56 563\n\n-- \nwww.tos-dr.info // www.twitter.com/tosdr // www.github.com/Unhosted/ToS-DR\n--- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups \"Terms of Service; Didn't Read\" group.\nTo post to this group, send email to tosdr@googlegroups.com.\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send email to tosdr+unsubscribe@googlegroups.com.\nVisit this group at http://groups.google.com/group/tosdr?hl=en.\nFor more options, visit https://groups.google.com/groups/opt_out.\n\n\n"},

We\nthought it would be a good idea to introduce ourselves here as well. I\nam currently working on a project to rate Terms of Service:\n        http://www.tos-dr.info \n        tosdr@googlegroups.com is our mailing-list (don't hesitate to\n        join, we need more people to discuss legal issues, especially\n        from the US; and more opinions and dialogue)\n        \nOur goal is to stop the biggest lie on the Web, no less! :) I am\nreferring of course to \"I have read and agree to the Terms of Service\"\nso we want to raise awareness so that people understand what they sign\nup for e.g. when they use Facebook or Twitter.\n\nOf course, we're doing it the free software way. The website is under\nAGPL-3.0 and our raw data (json files) CCBySA-3.0 and we're looking to\nwork on top of tosback2 and other groups (you might also be interested\nin giving a look at tossos.com) \n\n\n\nNow maybe let me get more specific. For ToS;DR we needed to create\nobjects for each service with some data, e.g. with Facebook:\nhttps://github.com/unhosted/ToS-DR/blob/master/services/facebook.json\n\n        {\n          \"id\": \"facebook\",\n          \"service\": \"Facebook\",\n          \"url\": \"https://www.facebook.com\",\n          \"rated\": false,\n          \"tos\": {\n            \"terms\": \"https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms\",\n            \"privacy\": \"https://www.facebook.com/full_data_use_policy\"\n          },\n          \"related\": [\n            \"diaspora\"\n          ],\n          \"last-diff\": \"https://www.tosback.org/diff.php?vid=1740\",\n          \"last-archive\": \"\", \n          \"date\": \"2011-07-07\",\n          \"clause\": [\n            \"kizrN7qb1Ck\",\n            \"kizrN7qb1Ck2\",\n            \"VTlWfubfib4\",\n            \"eff-back-in-congress\",\n            \"eff-back-tell-user-no\",\n            \"eff-back-transparency-data-50\"\n          ]\n        }\n        \n^^^ a lot of this stuff is not finished, it was just written there as a\ndraft: for instance the last-diff thing , etc. All this will probably be\nwritten in more details to be conform with tosback2.\n        \nSome of this information might be redundant with what tosback2's already\ndoing. Especially, it has always been our goal to integrate with\ntosback2 -- so now that I have more information, we need to find a way\nto build upon something like tosback2's facebook xml files:\n      * https://github.com/pde/tosback2/blob/master/rules/facebook.com.xml (the most recent file)\n      * https://github.com/pde/tosback2/blob/master/rules/facebook_Terms_of_Use.xml\n      * https://github.com/pde/tosback2/blob/master/rules/facebook_Privacy_Policy.xml\n\nSo my question is: how is Tosback2 supposed to make use of several\ndocuments for the same service? The case of Facebook is very common as\nmany services maintain separate documents for ToS and PP. (I want to\nmake a git pull request to give twitpic's ToS for instance, as so far\ntosback2-data only has the PP)\n\nThe other point is that we started to maintain different objects for\nservice id and service url. So I wonder about the choice to maintain a\nxml filename different from <sitename> (in the two older files) or if\nthis is deprecated.

Maybe I should just map\nthe facebook maze^W website.\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/help/?faq=186325668085084#What-information-does-Facebook-get-about-me-when-I-visit-a-website-with-a-Facebook-social-plug-in?\n        since the Like button is a little piece of Facebook embedded on\n        another website, the browser is sending information about the\n        request to load Facebook content on that page. We record some of\n        this information for a limited amount of time\nTODO: what's that limited amount of time? (see below I assume)\n        when you go to a website with a Like button, we need to know who\n        you are […]  The data we receive includes your user ID, the\n        website you're visiting, the date and time, and other\n        browser-related information. \n        \n        If you’re logged out or don’t have a Facebook account and visit\n        a website with the Like button or another social plugin, […] We\n        do receive the web page you're visiting, the date and time, and\n        other browser-related information. We record this information\n        for a limited amount of time […] we sometimes find bugs in the\n        systems we’ve built to gather aggregate data on how people are\n        interacting with sites that use the Like button or other social\n        plugins. It’s helpful to be able to reference this anonymized\n        information when investigating these bugs so we can find their\n        source and fix them quickly.\n        \n\"anonymized information\"???? WTH. They have \"browser-related\ninformation\" although they don't have the facebook user id. Is that\nreally anonymity? what's browser-related information? is a cookie\nbrowser-related?\n\nFortunately the last part gives us some guarantee; but I'd be more\nconfident if they were in the terms rather than an help page…\n\n        we do not use the information we receive when you visit a site\n        with the “Like” button or another social plugin to create a\n        profile of your browsing behavior on third-party sites or to\n        show you ads, although we may use anonymous or aggregate data to\n        improve ads generally. We delete or anonymize the information we\n        receive within 90 days, and we don't sell it to advertisers or\n        share it without your permission.\n        \nNow. That's an interesting question: they say they \"delete or anonymize\"\nwhich supposes that the information is previously not anonymous -- I\nsuppose that refers to information recorded on users logged-in.\n\nSo as I understand, that means that for information gathered on users\nwho are logged-in, Facebook keeps the information  forever (except the\nuser-id). That information includes \"the web page you're visiting, the\ndate and time, and other browser-related information\".\n\nTODO: facebook states they don't sell or share it unless they have \"your\npermission\". I wonder where that permission comes from: is there a\nprivacy setting somewhere for this? \n-- \nHugo Roy \n  French Coordinator, FSFE       chat: hugo@jabber.fsfe.org\n  www.fsfe.org/about/roy         mobile: +336 08 74 13 41\n                                 mobile DE: +49 151 143 56 563\n\n-- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups \"Terms of Service; Didn't Read\" group.\nTo post to this group, send email to tosdr@googlegroups.com.\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send email to tosdr+unsubscribe@googlegroups.com.\nFor more options, visit this group at http://groups.google.com/group/tosdr?hl=en.\n\n"},

Sie\ngelten für Ihre Nutzung der von PayPal angebotenen Dienstleistungen. Wir\nstellen Ihnen diese Nutzungsbedingungen auf Deutsch zur Verfügung –\ndementsprechend ist Deutsch die Vertragssprache.\n\nTeil dieser Nutzungsbedingungen sind außerdem folgende Bestimmungen:\n\n   - Nutzungsrichtlinie\n   - Käufer- und Verkäuferschutzrichtlinie\n\nJegliche zukünftige Änderungen dieser Nutzungsbedingungen, die schon in dem\nDokument „Aktualisierte PayPal Richtlinien“ auf der PayPal-Website unter\ndem Link \"AGB\" veröffentlicht sind, wenn Sie sich für ein PayPal Konto\nanmelden, gelten als Teil dieser Nutzungsbedingungen und treten für Sie zu\ndem Datum in Kraft, das in den Aktualisierten PayPal-Richtlinien  genannt\nist.\n\nDie Nutzungsbedingungen und alle weiteren rechtlichen Bestimmungen oder\nInformationen in Bezug auf unsere Dienstleistungen stehen Ihnen jederzeit\nauf der PayPal-Website unter dem Link \"AGB\" zur Verfügung. Auf Wunsch\nkönnen wir Ihnen diese auch zusenden. Wir weisen außerdem an relevanten\nStellen auf der PayPal-Webseite noch einmal auf unsere Nutzungsbedingungen\nhin.\n\nMehr über das Angebot von PayPal erfahren Sie in den Wesentlichen Hinweisen\nzu unserem Service.\n\n*1. Allgemeines*\n\n*1.1 PayPal erbringt ausschließlich Zahlungsdienstleistungen.*\nMit PayPal können Sie Zahlungen senden und empfangen. Dabei ist PayPal ein\nunabhängiger Auftragnehmer. Das bedeutet: Wir haben keine Kontrolle über\nWaren oder Dienstleistungen, die mit PayPal bezahlt werden und übernehmen\ndafür auch keine Haftung. Und wir sind nicht dafür verantwortlich, dass der\nGeschäftsvorgang zwischen Käufer und Verkäufer erfolgreich abgeschlossen\nwird. Wir können nicht garantieren, dass Nutzer Ihre Identität zutreffend\nangegeben haben. Es besteht deshalb das Risiko, dass Sie es mit\nMinderjährigen zu tun haben oder mit Personen, die unter falschem Namen\nauftreten.\n\n*Wichtig zu wissen:*\n\nPayPal hat eine Luxemburger Banklizenz im Sinne des Artikels 2 des Gesetzes\nvom 5. April 1993 über das Kreditwesen. Damit unterstehen wir der\nLuxemburger Bankenaufsicht, der *Commission de Surveillance du Secteur\nFinancier.*\n\nDie Hauptgeschäftstätigkeit von PayPal liegt in der Ausgabe von E-Geld und\nden mit der Ausgabe von E-Geld eng verbundenen Leistungen. Unser Service\nstellt insbesondere keine Einlagen- oder Anlagendienstleistung im Sinne des\noben genannten Kreditwesengesetzes dar. Das bedeutet für Sie: Ein Guthaben\nauf Ihrem PayPal-Konto ist daher nicht durch das Luxemburger\nEinlagensicherungssystem der *Association pour la Garantie des Dépôts\nLuxembourg* (AGDL) geschützt.\n\nMehr über PayPal und unseren Service erfahren Sie in den Wesentlichen\nHinweisen zu unserem Service, die Sie unter dem Link \"AGB\" auf der\nPayPal-Webseite finden.\n\n*1.2 Ihre persönlichen Daten.* PayPal legt großen Wert auf den Schutz Ihrer\npersönlichen Daten. In unseren Datenschutzgrundsätzen erfahren Sie, wie\nIhre Daten bei PayPal geschützt sind. Und an wen genau wir Ihre Daten zu\nwelchem Zweck weitergeben.\n\n*1.3 Geistiges Eigentum.* Die folgenden Dinge sind entweder\nurheberrechtlich geschützt oder Marken, Dienstleistungszeichen oder\nHandelsgepflogenheiten von PayPal oder PayPals Lizenzgebern:\n\n   - Die Internetadressen (URLs) der PayPal-Website(s)\n   - Die Bezeichnung \"PayPal\"\n   - Sämtliche damit verbundenen Logos unserer Produkte und Dienstleistungen\n   - Sämtliche Seitenüberschriften, Grafiken, Icons auf Buttons sowie\n   Schriftzüge.\n\nSie dürfen diese nicht ohne unsere vorherige Zustimmung vervielfältigen,\nnachbilden, bearbeiten, ändern, ergänzen oder nutzen. Unsere HTML-Logos\nhingegen können Sie ohne vorherige Zustimmung nutzen, um dadurch\nInternetnutzer auf unser Leistungsangebot aufmerksam zu machen.\nVoraussetzung hierfür ist: Wir haben Ihnen diese Logos für Ihren\nOnline-Shop, zur Einbindung in Online-Auktionen, oder durch sogenannte\nAffiliate-Programme zur Verfügung gestellt. Sie dürfen diese HTML-Logos\njedoch nicht ändern, bearbeiten oder umgestalten. Oder in einer Art und\nWeise darstellen, die PayPal oder unser Leistungsangebot herabsetzt, oder\naber ein Sponsoring oder eine Unterstützung Ihrer Inhalte oder Waren\nsuggeriert.\n\n*1.4 Abtretung.* Sie dürfen keinerlei Rechte oder Verpflichtungen, die\nIhnen aus diesen Nutzungsbedingungen entstehen, ohne die vorherige\nschriftliche Zustimmung von PayPal übertragen oder abtreten. PayPal behält\nsich vor, diesen Vertrag oder daraus entstehende Rechte und Pflichten ohne\nIhre vorherige Zustimmung zu übertragen oder abzutreten. Ihr Recht, Ihr\nPayPal-Konto gemäß Ziffer 7.1 zu schließen, bleibt davon unberührt.\n\n*1.5 Mitteilungen von PayPal an Sie.* Sie stimmen zu, dass PayPal Sie auf\nfolgenden Wegen kontaktieren bzw. benachrichtigen darf:\n\n   - *Per E-Mail:* Wir senden eine E-Mail an die E-Mail-Adresse, die Sie in\n   Ihrem PayPal-Konto hinterlegt haben.\n   - *Online: *Per Veröffentlichung auf der PayPal-Website(s) oder in Ihrem\n   PayPal-Konto.\n   - *Per Post:* Wir senden die Mitteilung an die Anschrift, die Sie in\n   Ihrem PayPal-Konto hinterlegt haben.\n   - *Per Telefon:·* Wir rufen Sie an oder senden Ihnen eine SMS.\n\nSie können eine Kopie sämtlicher rechtlicher Veröffentlichungen\n(einschließlich dieser Nutzungsbedingungen) bei uns anfordern. Wir werden\nIhnen diese in einem Format zur Verfügung stellen, das Sie dauerhaft\nabspeichern und abrufen können (z.B. als E-Mail). Sie können Ihre\nZustimmung zum Erhalt dieser Informationen auf elektronischem Wege durch\nMitteilung an PayPal gemäß Ziffer 1.6 widerrufen. Wenn Sie die Zusendung\nder Dokumente auf Papier wünschen, berechnen wir dafür eine\nDokumentengebühr (vgl. Anhang 1). Wir behalten uns das Recht vor, Ihr\nPayPal-Konto zu schließen, wenn Sie Ihre Zustimmung zum Erhalt von\nelektronischer Kommunikation widerrufen.\n\n*1.6 Mitteilungen an PayPal.* Mitteilungen an PayPal im Zusammenhang mit\nden vorliegenden Nutzungsbedingungen müssen per Post an unseren\nHauptgeschäftssitz unter folgender Anschrift geschickt werden:\n\nPayPal (Europe) S.à r.l. et Cie, S.C.A.\nRechtsabteilung\n22–24 Boulevard Royal\nL-2449 Luxemburg\n\n*1.7 Kontoauszug.* Sie können alle ausgeführten Zahlungsaufträge sowie\nIhren PayPal-Kontostand und weitere Informationen jederzeit abrufen, indem\nSie sich in Ihr PayPal-Konto einloggen. Sie erklären sich damit\neinverstanden, Ihren Kontoauszug online einzusehen, da wir keine\nregelmäßigen Kontoauszüge per Post verschicken.\n\n*1.8 Änderung dieser Nutzungsbedingungen.* Änderungen dieser\nNutzungsbedingungen werden Ihnen spätestens zwei Monate vor dem\nvorgeschlagenen Zeitpunkt ihres Wirksamwerdens in Textform (z.B. per\nE-Mail) angeboten. Ihre Zustimmung gilt als erteilt, wenn Sie Ihre\nAblehnung nicht vor dem vorgeschlagenen Zeitpunkt des Wirksamwerdens der\nÄnderungen angezeigt haben. Wenn Sie mit den Änderungen nicht einverstanden\nsind, können Sie diese Vereinbarung vor dem vorgeschlagenen Zeitpunkt des\nWirksamwerdens der Änderung fristlos und kostenfrei kündigen. Wir weisen\nSie in der Nachricht, mit der wir Ihnen die Änderungen anbieten, auch noch\neinmal besonders auf Ihr Ablehnungsrecht, die Frist dafür und Ihre\nMöglichkeit zur Kündigung hin. Zusätzlich veröffentlichen wir die\nÄnderungen der Nutzungsbedingungen auf den PayPal-Website(s).\n\nWenn wir lediglich eine neue Dienstleistung oder eine neue Funktionalität\neinführen oder Änderungen machen, die Ihre Rechte oder Pflichten nicht\nbeeinträchtigen, können wir das mit einer Frist von nur einem Monat\nankündigen. Die Widerspruchsfrist beträgt dann drei Wochen.\n\n*2. Anmeldung und Kontotypen *\n\n*2.1 Anmeldung.* Sie können sich bei PayPal in Deutschland nur anmelden,\nwenn Sie volljährig sind und einen Wohnsitz bzw. Geschäftssitz in\nDeutschland haben. Sie bestätigen uns hiermit außerdem, dass Sie nicht in\nverdeckter Stellvertretung für einen Dritten oder einen wirtschaftlich\nBerechtigten handeln.\n\n*2.2 Kontotypen.* Wir bieten zwei verschiedene Arten von Konten an: Konten\nfür Käufer und private Verkäufer sowie Geschäftskonten. Sie dürfen\ngleichzeitig nur Inhaber eines Kontos für Käufer und private Verkäufer und\neines Geschäftskontos sein.\n\n   1. *Konto für Käufer und private Verkäufer (Privatkonto) und\n   Geschäftskonto.* Sie können bei PayPal ein Privat- oder Geschäftskonto\n   eröffnen. Ein Privatkonto muss hauptsächlich privat genutzt werden. Ein\n   Geschäftskonto hingegen dürfen Sie nicht für private Zwecke eröffnen,\n   sondern nur für ein Gewerbe oder Unternehmen.\n   2. *Zahlungs- und Reservefunktion.* Ihr PayPal-Konto hat automatisch\n   zwei verschiedene Funktionalitäten: eine Zahlungsfunktion und eine\n   Reservefunktion. Zur Vereinfachung nennen wir diese Funktionalitäten\n   nachfolgend Zahlungskonto und Reservekonto.\n\nInwieweit Sie Zahlungen ausführen oder Guthaben abheben können, hängt davon\nab, ob das jeweilige Guthaben in Ihrem Zahlungs- oder Reservekonto ist.\n\nGuthaben auf Ihrem Zahlungskonto: Sie können frei über dieses Guthaben\nverfügen und es auf Ihr Bankkonto abbuchen oder für Zahlungen nutzen.\n\nGuthaben auf Ihrem Reservekonto: Dieses Guthaben steht Ihnen vorübergehend\nnicht zur Verfügung – es wird in Ihrem PayPal-Konto als \"nicht verfügbares\nGuthaben\" angezeigt. Das heißt, Sie können es nicht auf Ihr Bankkonto\nabbuchen oder für Zahlungen nutzen. Dazu gehören alle Zahlungen, die den\nStatus \"offen\" oder \"einbehalten\" haben - denn diese werden aus Gründen der\nRisikoabsicherung nicht sofort freigegeben. Das kann beispielsweise der\nFall sein bei:\n\n   - PayPal-Zahlungen, bei denen die Zahlungsquelle eine Lastschrift mit\n   Sicherheitsprüfung ist (vgl. Ziffer 3.7)\n   - Zahlungen, die der Händler erst später abschließt (vgl. Ziffer 3.9)\n   - Zahlungsprüfungen (vgl. Ziffer 4.3)\n   - Vorübergehend einbehaltene Zahlungen (vgl. Ziffer 10.5 und 10.6)\n   - Verbotenen Aktivitäten und entsprechenden Maßnahmen durch PayPal (vgl.\n   Ziffer 9 und 10)\n\n*2.3 Verifizierung.* Um Ihr PayPal-Konto zu verifizieren, ist Folgendes\nnötig:\n\n   - Bankkonto hinzufügen und bestätigen. Sie bestätigen Ihr Bankkonto,\n   indem Sie entweder die beiden Gutschriften zur Bankkontobestätigung in\n   Ihrem PayPal-Konto eingeben, oder eine Zahlung per Banküberweisung oder\n   giropay durchführen.\n   - Kreditkarte hinzufügen und bestätigen. Sie bestätigen Ihre\n   Kreditkarte, indem Sie den Code zur Kreditkartenbestätigung in Ihrem\n   PayPal-Konto eingeben.\n\nGegebenenfalls fragen wir zusätzliche Informationen zur Verifizierung von\nIhnen an, um Geldwäschevorschriften zu erfüllen. Zum Beispiel können wir\nSie bitten, uns per Fax, E-Mail oder durch Hochladen in Ihrem PayPal-Konto\nAusweisdokumente zur Verfügung zu stellen.\n\nBei Geschäftskonten müssen Sie zusätzliche Informationen zu Ihrem\nUnternehmen zur Verfügung stellen.\nWenn der Status eines PayPal-Kontos bzw. PayPal-Kunden als \"verifiziert\"\nangezeigt wird, bedeutet dies lediglich, dass der Kontoinhaber die\nobengenannten Schritte durchgeführt hat. PayPal übernimmt keine Haftung\ndafür, dass der jeweilige Kontoinhaber Geschäfte ordnungsgemäß durchführt.\n\n*3. Zahlungen senden*\n\n*3.1 Zahlungen senden (Ausführung von Zahlungsaufträgen).* Wenn Sie eine\nZahlung mit PayPal senden, erteilen Sie uns damit einen Zahlungsauftrag.\nFür die Ausführung von Zahlungsaufträgen nach Maßgabe dieser Vereinbarung\ngilt eine Frist von einem Geschäftstag als vereinbart. Innerhalb dieser\nFrist werden wir einen über Ihr Zahlungskonto erteilten Zahlungsauftrag\nausführen, indem wir den angewiesenen Betrag, dem Zahlungsdienstleister\nIhres Empfängers gutschreiben. Die Frist beginnt am Tag, nachdem Sie uns\neinen gültigen Zahlungsauftrag erteilt und wir diesen erhalten haben.\n\nFür die Ausführung eines Zahlungsauftrags gelten folgende Voraussetzungen:\n\n   1. Sie erteilen einen Zahlungsauftrag vor 16 Uhr an einem Geschäftstag\n   (es gilt die Ortszeit des Landes, in dem Sie Ihr PayPal-Konto registriert\n   haben). Wenn Sie uns einen Zahlungsauftrag nach 16 Uhr oder an einem\n   Feiertag erteilen, gilt der Zahlungsauftrag als am nächsten Geschäftstag\n   eingegangen;\n   2. Sie haben uns bei Erteilung des Zahlungsauftrags eine korrekte\n   Kundenkennung angegeben oder uns andere, gültige Informationen zum\n   Zahlungsempfänger bzw. über Sie selbst gegeben, die PayPal oder auch der\n   Zahlungsempfänger von Ihnen in einem vernünftigen Maße erfragen kann;\n   3. Sie haben alle Pflichtfelder beim Einkauf bzw. Bezahlungsvorgang\n   ausgefüllt;\n   4. Sie haben die notwendigen Angaben zu Ihrer/n Zahlungsquelle(n)\n   gemacht, die jeweils eine ausreichende Deckung aufweisen; und\n   5. Sie haben uns wirksam zur Ausführung des Zahlungsauftrags ermächtigt.\n   Die Ermächtigung gilt in folgenden Fällen als wirksam erteilt:\n      1. Wenn Sie auf einen Zahlungsbutton (wie zum Beispiel \"Zahlen\" oder\n      \"Weiter\") auf der PayPal-Website klicken, um uns damit einen\n      Zahlungsauftrag zu senden, nachdem Sie die richtigen\nAnmeldedaten angegeben\n      haben und sich in Ihr PayPal-Konto eingeloggt haben; und/oder\n      2. Wenn Sie mit einem Dritten ein Einzugsverfahren vereinbart haben,\n      aufgrund dessen ein Händler oder anderer Dritter von Ihnen die Erlaubnis\n      erhalten hat, Zahlungen direkt von Ihrem PayPal-Konto\neinzuziehen; und/oder\n      3. Wenn Sie uns auf einem anderen Weg den Auftrag erteilen, soweit\n      wir Ihnen diesen Weg jeweils mitgeteilt haben.\n\nWir sind nur dann verpflichtet, den Zahlungsauftrag innerhalb von einem\nGeschäftstag nach dessen Eingang auszuführen, wenn:\n\n   - es sich um eine Zahlung zwischen PayPal-Konten handelt, die in einem\n   Land des Europäischen Wirtschaftsraums (\"EWR\") registriert sind,\n   - diese Zahlung in Euro, Britischen Pfund oder einer anderen Währung\n   eines EWR-Landes erfolgt, das nicht den Euro eingeführt hat.\n\nEinen Zahlungsauftrag können Sie nicht widerrufen, nachdem er bei uns\neingegangen ist. Dies gilt nicht, wenn Sie eine Einzugsermächtigung für\nwiederkehrende Zahlungen erteilt haben. Eine solche können Sie jeweils bis\nzum Ende des Geschäftstages, bevor die nächste Zahlung ausgeführt werden\nsoll, widerrufen.\n\nWir sind nicht verpflichtet, Zahlungsaufträge auszuführen, wenn Sie weder\nausreichendes Guthaben auf Ihrem PayPal-Konto noch eine ausreichend\ngedeckte Zahlungsquelle vorweisen können. Wir sind berechtigt, einen\nZahlungsauftrag solange nicht auszuführen, bis wir Geld von Ihnen erhalten\nhaben.\n\n*3.2 Sendelimit.* Wenn für Ihr Konto ein jährliches Sendelimit besteht,\nkönnen Sie sich dieses nach dem Einloggen in Ihr Konto unter \"Kontolimits\"\nauf der Seite \"Mein Konto\" anzeigen lassen. \"Jährlich\" bezieht sich dabei\nauf das Kalenderjahr. Im Rahmen unseres Risikomanagements können wir\nzusätzliche Limitierungen vornehmen, um das Risiko von Zahlungsausfall und\nBetrug zu verringern.\n\n*3.3. Sendelimit aufheben.* Sie können Ihr Sendelimit aufheben, indem Sie\nIhr PayPal-Konto verifizieren (siehe Ziffer 2.3).\n\n*3.4 Standard-Zahlungsquellen.* Wenn Sie mit PayPal zahlen oder Ihr\nPayPal-Konto aufladen, ermächtigen Sie uns, Geld von einer Ihrer\nStandard-Zahlungsquellen zu verwenden. Wir geben Ihnen daraufhin E-Geld zum\ngleichen Betrag aus und schreiben dieses entsprechend Ihrer Anweisung\nentweder dem PayPal-Konto des Zahlungsempfängers oder Ihrem eigenen\nPayPal-Konto gut.\n\nWir nutzen Ihre Zahlungsquellen in folgender Reihenfolge (soweit die\njeweiligen Zahlungsquellen bei Ihrem Konto zur Verfügung stehen):\n\n   1. PayPal-Guthaben\n   2. Lastschrift\n   3. Kreditkarte\n   4. giropay\n   5. Banküberweisung\n\nWenn Sie ausreichend Guthaben auf Ihrem PayPal-Konto haben, nutzen wir\ndieses immer zuerst. Wenn Ihr Guthaben nur für einen Teil der Zahlung\nausreicht, verwenden wir für den Restbetrag Lastschrift oder Ihre\nKreditkarte. Sind nur giropay oder Banküberweisung verfügbar, nutzen wir\ndiese Zahlungsquellen für den Gesamtbetrag.\n\n*3.5 Bevorzugte Zahlungsquelle.* Wenn Sie mit PayPal zahlen, zeigen wir\nIhnen jedes Mal an, welche Zahlungsquelle wir verwenden. Wenn Sie eine\nandere Zahlungsquelle auswählen möchten, können Sie das an dieser Stelle\ntun.\n\nWenn Sie einen Händler oder einen anderen Dritten ermächtigt haben,\nZahlungen von Ihrem PayPal-Konto einzuziehen, können Sie in Ihrem Profil\neine bevorzugte Zahlungsquelle dafür festlegen.\n\nUnabhängig davon, welche bevorzugte Zahlungsquelle Sie festgelegt haben,\nnutzen wir immer zuerst ein vorhandenes Guthaben. Wenn Sie das nicht\nmöchten, sollten Sie Ihr Guthaben auf Ihr Bankkonto abbuchen.\n\nAuch wenn ein Händler bzw. der andere Dritte Ihre Zahlung später einzieht,\nverwenden wir ein zu diesem Zeitpunkt vorhandenes Guthaben zuerst. Nur für\neinen eventuellen Restbetrag verwenden wir Ihre bevorzugte Zahlungsquelle.\n\n*3.6 Ausschluss von Zahlungsquellen.* PayPal kann im Rahmen seines\nRisikomanagements bestimmte Zahlungsquellen für ausgewählte Transaktionen\nausschließen. Wenn wir eine Zahlungsquelle ausschließen, werden wir Sie\ndarauf hinweisen, welche andere Zahlungsquelle wir stattdessen nutzen. Zur\nNutzung von \"PayPal Business Payments\" können Sie als Zahlungsquelle nur\nein auf Ihrem PayPal-Konto befindliches Guthaben verwenden.\n\n*3.7 Lastschrift.* Bei einer Zahlung mit Lastschrift geben Sie uns eine\nEinzugsermächtigung, den Betrag von Ihrem bei PayPal hinterlegten Bankkonto\neinzuziehen. Dabei passiert im Hintergrund Folgendes:\n\n   - Ihre Bank erhält den Zahlungsauftrag, den Betrag an PayPal zu zahlen.\n   - PayPal erhält wiederum den Zahlungsauftrag, den entsprechenden\n   E-Geld-Betrag an den Zahlungsempfänger zu zahlen.\n\nIm Falle einer Rücklastschrift, die Sie nicht persönlich veranlasst haben,\nermächtigen Sie PayPal, zu einem späteren Zeitpunkt erneut eine Lastschrift\ndurchzuführen. Es sei denn, Sie haben den ausstehenden Betrag bereits auf\nandere Weise ausgeglichen.\n\nIm Falle einer fehlgeschlagenen Lastschrift, ermächtigen Sie PayPal, Ihre\nKreditkarte bzw. ein anderes bei PayPal hinterlegtes Bankkonto mit dem\nZahlbetrag zuzüglich der Gebühr für fehlgeschlagene Lastschriften gemäß\nAnhang 1 (Gebührenaufstellung) Ziffer 4 zu belasten oder den Zahlbetrag und\ndie Gebühr erneut zu versuchen durch Lastschrift von ihrem Bankkonto\neinzuziehen, es sei denn, Sie haben den ausstehenden Betrag bereits auf\nandere Weise ausgeglichen. Sie werden während des Zahlungsvorgangs darauf\nhingewiesen, welche Zahlungsquelle wir hierfür ggf. verwenden. Diese\nZahlungsquellen gelten auch dann, wenn Sie das Einzugsverfahren gemäß\nZiffer 3.10 nutzen, als zusätzliche Standard-Zahlungsquellen.\n\nEine Zahlung im Lastschriftverfahren kann einer routinemäßigen\nSicherheitsprüfung unterzogen werden. Falls wir aufgrund unserer internen\nRisikoprüfung bezüglich des Lastverfahrens Grund zur Annahme haben, dass im\nZusammenhang mit dieser Zahlung ein erhöhtes Risiko besteht, so haben wir\ndiese Möglichkeiten\n\n   - Wir schließen die Zahlung auf Seiten des Zahlungsempfängers ggf. nicht\n   sofort ab und führen eine Zahlungsprüfung nach Ziffer 4.3 durch. Wenn sich\n   hierbei herausstellt, dass es ein Problem mit der Zahlung gibt, werden wir\n   die Zahlung rückgängig machen. Das bedeutet, wir buchen sie vom\n   Reservekonto des Verkäufers auf das PayPal-Konto des Käufers zurück; oder\n   - Solange nach unseren Risikomodellen ein erhöhtes Risiko besteht, dass\n   eine Zahlung von Ihrer Bank abgelehnt oder zurückgebucht wird, müssen wir\n   davon ausgehen, dass der entsprechende Betrag zur Finanzierung der\n   E-Geld-Zahlung noch nicht zur Verfügung steht. In diesem Fall behandeln wir\n   Ihren Zahlungsauftrag als gemäß Ziffer 3.1 ungültig.\n\nWir nutzen die folgenden Hauptparameter zu unserer internen\nRisikoevaluierung im Zusammenhang mit Lastschriftverfahren:\n\n   - Risiko, dass auf Ihrem Bankkonto ungenügend Guthaben oder\n   Verfügungslimit bestehen könnte\n   - Risiko, dass die Zahlung nicht korrekt vom Kontoinhaber des Bankkontos\n   autorisiert wurde,\n   - Risiko, dass die Kontendaten des Bankkontos nicht richtig sind und\n   damit die Transaktion unrichtig ausgeführt wird.\n\n*3.8 Ablehnen von Zahlungen durch den Empfänger.* Wenn Sie E-Geld senden,\nist der Empfänger nicht verpflichtet, diese Zahlung anzunehmen, auch wenn\ndas E-Geld dem Empfänger bereits zur Verfügung steht. Wenn der Empfänger\neine Zahlung ablehnt, zurückerstattet oder nicht innerhalb von 30 Tagen\nannimmt, schreiben wir den entsprechenden Betrag Ihrem PayPal-Konto gut.\nFalls Sie mit Kreditkarte bezahlt haben, schreiben wir den Betrag direkt\nIhrem Kreditkartenkonto gut. Wir haften nicht für Schäden, die durch die\nEntscheidung eines Empfängers verursacht werden, eine Zahlung nicht\nanzunehmen.\n\n*3.9 Händler schließt Zahlung später ab.* Bei Ihrem Einkauf erteilen Sie\nbestimmten Händlern die Erlaubnis, die Zahlung erst zu einem späteren\nZeitpunkt abzuschließen. Das ist beispielsweise dann der Fall, wenn der\nGesamtpreis beim Einkaufen noch nicht feststeht. Dabei können Sie mit dem\nHändler vereinbaren, dass dieser den Gesamtpreis bis zu einem mit Ihnen\nvereinbarten Maximalbetrag noch anpassen darf (zum Beispiel aufgrund von\nnoch nicht feststehender Materialkosten). Ihre Erlaubnis gegenüber dem\nHändler kann bis zu 30 Tage gültig sein. Sie ermächtigen PayPal in diesem\nFall, die Zahlung bis zum vereinbarten Maximalbetrag entsprechend den\nAngaben des Händlers durchzuführen. PayPal ist nicht verpflichtet, die\nAngaben des Händlers zu überprüfen.\n\nWenn Sie zu dem Zeitpunkt, an dem Sie PayPal den Zahlungsauftrag erteilt\nhaben, ein Guthaben auf Ihrem PayPal-Konto haben, wird PayPal den\nentsprechenden Betrag in Ihrem Reservekonto halten. Die Zahlung erscheint\nin Ihrem PayPal-Konto dann als \"offen\", bis der Händler die Zahlung\nabschließt. Falls für Ihre Zahlung eine Währungsumrechnung nötig ist,\nberechnen wir den Wechselkurs zum Zeitpunkt, an dem der Händler die Zahlung\nabschließt.\n\n*3.10 Einzugsverfahren.* Sie können einem Dritten (z.B. einem Händler)\ngegenüber die Ermächtigung erteilen, direkt von Ihrem PayPal-Konto\nZahlungen einzuziehen. Rückerstattungen auf eBay über PayPal, die Sie als\nHändler auf eBay tätigen, können ebenfalls im Einzugsverfahren von PayPal\nabgewickelt werden.\n\nSie weisen uns in diesem Fall an, dem Dritten die angeforderten Beträge von\nIhrem PayPal-Konto zur Verfügung zu stellen. Dies gilt so lange, bis Sie\nIhre Vereinbarung mit dem Dritten kündigen. PayPal ist nicht verpflichtet,\nden Einzug des Dritten daraufhin zu prüfen, ob er mit der Ihnen getroffenen\nVereinbarung übereinstimmt.\n\nIn Ihrem PayPal-Konto können Sie sehen, mit welchen Dritten Sie das\nEinzugsverfahren vereinbart haben. Wir benachrichtigen Sie jedoch nicht im\nVoraus über Zahlungen, die per Einzugsverfahren erfolgen. Sie können eine\nsolche Vorab-Benachrichtigung aber vom jeweiligen Händler einfordern.\nSofern der Einzug durch einen Dritten eine Währungsumrechnung erfordert,\nfällt die zum Zeitpunkt des Einzugs geltende Wechselkursgebühr an. Die\nUmrechnung wird zum jeweils aktuellen Wechselkurs ausgeführt, so dass bei\nwiederholten Zahlungen unterschiedliche Wechselkurse gelten können.\n\nWenn Sie als Dritter das Einzugsverfahren nutzen, sichern Sie PayPal\nhiermit zu, dass die eingezogenen Beträge der Vereinbarung mit Ihrem Kunden\nentsprechen.\n\nSie sind außerdem verpflichtet, Ihre Kunden eine angemessene Zeit vor dem\nEinzug darauf hinzuweisen. Wenn der einzuziehende Betrag sich erhöht hat,\nohne dass dies für den Kunden vernünftigerweise vorhersehbar war, wobei für\ndiese Beurteilung das vorhergehende Ausgabeverhalten des Kunden und die\nUmstände der Zahlung heranzuziehen sind, müssen Sie den Kunden mindestens\nvier Wochen im Voraus über die Höhe des einzuziehenden Betrags informieren.\nBei einer Verletzung der in diesem Absatz genannten Pflichten haften Sie\nuns gegenüber für sämtliche Rückbuchungen dieser Zahlung, es sei denn, die\nRückbuchung ist nicht durch die Pflichtverletzung verursacht.\n\nSie können eine Rückbuchung von erfolgten Einzügen nur in folgenden Fällen\nverlangen:\n\n   1. wenn der abgebuchte Betrag den Betrag übersteigt, dessen Abbuchung\n   Sie vernünftigerweise unter Einbeziehung Ihres früheren Ausgabeverhaltens\n   und der Umstände des Falles hätten erwarten können, *oder *\n   2. wenn Sie Ihre Zustimmung zum Einzugsverfahren nicht entsprechend\n   Ziffer 3.1 (e) erteilt haben; *oder*\n   3. wenn Sie nicht in angemessener Zeit vor dem Einzug darüber informiert\n   wurden, dass dieser erfolgen wird, *und*\n   4. wenn Sie uns innerhalb von 8 Wochen, nachdem der Einzug erfolgte,\n   mitteilen, dass Sie eine Rückbuchung verlangen, *und*\n   5. wenn Sie uns entsprechende Informationen zur Prüfung des Falles zur\n   Verfügung stellen.\n\nEin Anspruch auf Rückbuchung von erfolgten Einzügen besteht jedoch nicht,\nwenn Sie Ihre Zustimmung zum Einzugsverfahren uns gegenüber entsprechend\nZiffer 3.1 (e) erteilt haben und mindestens vier Wochen vor der Abbuchung\nvon uns oder dem das Einzugsverfahren nutzenden Dritten über den Einzug\ninformiert wurden. Wir behalten uns vor, weitere Informationen von Ihnen\nanzufordern, um überprüfen zu können, ob die oben genannten Voraussetzungen\nerfüllt sind.\n\n*3.11 Kündigung des Einzugsverfahrens.* Sie können einem Dritten gegenüber\ndas Einzugsverfahren über das Profil Ihres PayPal-Kontos kündigen. Die\nKündigung muss spätestens einen Tag vor dem nächsten Einzugstermin erfolgen.\n\n*3.12 Versand von E-Geld in verschiedenen Währungen.* Sie können Beträge in\nfolgenden Währungen senden:\n\n   - US-Dollar\n   - Kanadische Dollar\n   - Euro\n   - Britische Pfund\n   - Yen\n   - Argentinische Peso\n   - Brasilianische Real\n   - Australische Dollar\n   - Tschechische Kronen\n   - Dänische Kronen\n   - Hongkong-Dollar\n   - Ungarische Forint\n   - Israelische Schekel\n   - Malaysische Ringgit\n   - Mexikanische Peso\n   - Taiwan-Dollar\n   - Neuseeland-Dollar\n   - Norwegische Kronen\n   - Polnische Zloty\n   - Philippinische Peso\n   - Russische Rubel (nach Einführung des Russischen Rubel bei PayPal)\n   - Singapur-Dollar\n   - Schwedische Kronen\n   - Schweizer Franken\n   - Thailändische Baht\n   - Türkische Lira\n\nEs kann jedoch Beschränkungen geben, inwieweit Sie welche Währungen senden\noder empfangen dürfen. Wenn Sie einen Artikel bezahlen möchten, der in\neiner anderen Währung als Ihrer Hauptwährung angeboten wird, müssen Sie\nangeben, in welcher der beiden Währungen Sie bezahlen möchten. Einige\nHändler bieten diese Auswahlmöglichkeit jedoch nicht.\n\nWenn Sie in einer Währung zahlen, die nicht Ihre Hauptwährung ist, gehen\nwir folgendermaßen vor:\n\n   1. Falls Sie über ein Guthaben in der gewünschten Währung verfügen,\n   nutzen wir dieses für die Zahlung.\n   2. Falls Sie über ein Guthaben in einer anderen Währung verfügen, nutzen\n   wir dieses und rechnen es in die gewünschte Währung um.\n   3. Falls Sie über kein Guthaben verfügen, nutzen wir eine andere\n   Standard-Zahlungsquelle und rechnen den Betrag in die gewünschte Währung um.\n\n*3.13 **Bankverbindung oder Kreditkartendaten.* Sollte sich Ihre\nBankverbindung oder Kreditkartennummer ändern, wird uns dies in einigen\nFällen durch unsere Bankpartner mitgeteilt. Wir können Sie dann darauf\nhinweisen, die Daten in Ihrem PayPal-Konto entsprechend zu aktualisieren.\nBitte sorgen Sie aber auch selbst dafür, dass die im PayPal-Konto\nhinterlegten Daten immer auf dem aktuellen Stand sind.\n\n*4. Zahlungseingänge*\n\n*4.1 Empfangslimit.* Wenn für Ihr Konto ein jährliches Empfangslimit\nbesteht, können Sie sich dieses nach dem Einloggen in Ihr Konto unter\n\"Kontolimits\" auf der Seite \"Mein Konto\" anzeigen lassen. \"Jährlich\"\nbezieht sich dabei auf das Kalenderjahr. Im Rahmen unseres\nRisikomanagements können wir zusätzliche Limitierungen vornehmen, um das\nRisiko von Zahlungsausfall und Betrug zu verringern. Wenn Sie darüber\nhinaus Zahlungen empfangen möchten, müssen Sie:\n\n   - Eine Zahlung per Banküberweisung oder giropay durchführen.\n   - Sich uns gegenüber ausweisen, z.B. indem Sie eine Kopie Ihres\n   Personalausweises einreichen.\n\nWir sind rechtlich dazu verpflichtet, bei Erreichen des Empfangslimits Ihre\nIdentität festzustellen. Welche Dokumente wir dazu und gegebenenfalls\naufgrund von Geldwäschevorschriften von Ihnen benötigen, teilen wir Ihnen\nper E-Mail mit.\n\n*4.2 PayPal-Zahlungen auf eBay empfangen.* Wenn Sie PayPal als\nZahlungsmethode in Ihren eBay-Angeboten anbieten, müssen Sie folgende\nRegeln beachten:\n\n   1. Wenn PayPal als Zahlungsmethode in Ihrem eBay-Angebot genannt ist,\n   müssen Sie PayPal-Zahlungen akzeptieren.\n   2. Sie müssen PayPal-Zahlungen unabhängig von der verwendeten\n   Zahlungsquelle akzeptieren (zum Beispiel Kreditkarte).\n   3. Sie müssen PayPal-Zahlungen aus den Ländern akzeptieren, in die Sie\n   nach Ihrem eBay-Angebot versenden.\n\n*4.3 Zahlungsprüfungen.* Zahlungen, die von uns als risikoreich bezüglich\nder in Ziffer 10.5 (a) beschriebenen Risiken angesehen werden, unterziehen\nwir einer Prüfung.\n\nBei einer Zahlungsprüfung macht PayPal Folgendes:\n\n   1. Wir führen den Zahlungsauftrag des Käufers aus;\n   2. Unmittelbar nach der Ausführung des Zahlungsauftrags schränken wir\n   die Verfügbarkeit des Zahlungsinstruments für den Käufer ein;\n   3. Wir kennzeichnen die Zahlung als \"offen\" und buchen sie auf das\n   Reservekonto des Zahlungsempfängers;\n   4. Wir fordern den Zahlungsempfänger auf, mit dem Versand des Artikels\n   an den Käufer abzuwarten (eine als \"offen\" markierte Zahlung ist auch nicht\n   durch den PayPal-Verkäuferschutz gemäß Ziffer 11 abgedeckt);\n   5. Wir prüfen die Zahlung.\n\nDie Zahlung wird solange im Konto des Zahlungsempfängers als \"offen\"\ngekennzeichnet, bis wir alle Informationen erhalten haben, um die\nZahlungsprüfung effizient gemäß Ziffer 10.5 (a) durchführen zu können. Wenn\nsich bei der Zahlungsprüfung herausstellt, dass es ein Problem mit der\nZahlung gibt, werden wir die Zahlung rückgängig machen. Das bedeutet, wir\nbuchen sie vom Reservekonto des Verkäufers auf das PayPal-Konto des Käufers\nzurück.\n\nAuch wenn die Zahlungsprüfung erfolgreich abgeschlossen wurde, kann eine\nZahlung dennoch aus anderen in dieser Vereinbarung genannten Gründen\nrückgängig gemacht werden. Sie kann dann jedoch unter den Verkäuferschutz\nnach Ziffer 11 fallen, wenn die sonstigen Voraussetzungen dafür erfüllt\nsind.\n\nDiese Prüfung dient der Sicherheit unserer Kunden und stellt keine negative\nBewertung der betroffenen Personen oder Unternehmen dar.\n\n*4.4 Zahlungsausfall.* Alle Zahlungen, die Sie auf Ihrem PayPal-Konto\nempfangen, sind E-Geld-Zahlungen. Sie haben diese erst dann tatsächlich in\nIhrem PayPal-Konto empfangen, wenn Sie die Zahlung akzeptieren (bzw. die\nautomatische Akzeptanz in Ihrem PayPal-Konto aktiviert haben). Wenn im\nFalle eines Zahlungsausfalls eine von Ihnen empfangene Zahlung rückgängig\ngemacht wird, haften Sie gegenüber PayPal für den Zahlungsbetrag und\netwaige Gebühren. In folgenden Fällen liegt ein Zahlungsausfall vor:\n\n   - Bei einer Rücklastschrift.\n   - Bei einer Kreditkartenrückbuchung.\n   - Wenn die Zahlung nicht durch den rechtmäßigen Inhaber des\n   PayPal-Kontos genehmigt wurde.\n   - Wenn wir bei einem Antrag auf Käuferschutz oder einer Käuferbeschwerde\n   zugunsten des Käufers entscheiden.\n\nEine Zahlung gilt auch dann als abgeschlossen, wenn sie aufgrund eines\nZahlungsausfalls wieder rückgängig gemacht wird. Bei einem Zahlungsausfall\nbuchen wir den Betrag (bei Kreditkartenrückbuchungen zuzüglich einer\nBearbeitungsgebühr) von Ihrem PayPal-Konto zurück. Wenn Sie nicht genug\nGuthaben auf Ihrem PayPal-Konto haben, können Sie es durch eine Einzahlung\nauf Ihr PayPal-Konto ausgleichen. Ansonsten behalten wir uns das Recht vor,\neingehende Zahlungen zum Ausgleich des ausstehenden Betrags zu verwenden\noder die in Ziffer 5.2 beschriebenen Maßnahmen zu ergreifen. Wir können\naußerdem rechtliche Schritte einleiten, um unsere Ansprüche gegen Sie\ndurchzusetzen, zum Beispiel durch Beauftragung eines Inkasso-Unternehmens.\n\nIm Falle einer Kreditkartenrückbuchung kann PayPal diese anfechten. Es\nentscheidet aber der Kreditkartenanbieter und nicht PayPal, ob diese\nrechtmäßig war.\n\nAls Zahlungsempfänger sind Sie nach Maßgabe des PayPal-Verkäuferschutzes\n(Ziffer 11) vor Zahlungsausfällen geschützt. Während wir Ihren Anspruch auf\nPayPal-Verkäuferschutz prüfen, kann Ihr Zugriff auf Ihr Guthaben\neingeschränkt werden.\n\n*4.5 Keine abwertende Darstellung von PayPal als Zahlungsmethode.* Wenn Sie\nPayPal als Zahlungsmethode anbieten, dürfen Sie PayPal gegenüber Ihren\nKunden oder in anderen Veröffentlichungen nicht fehlerhaft darstellen oder\nin Misskredit bringen. Sofern Sie für die Nutzung von PayPal Ihren Kunden\neinen Aufschlag berechnen, dürfen Sie das nur im rechtlich zulässigen\nRahmen und müssen Ihre Kunden darüber entsprechend selbst informieren, da\ndies anderenfalls (straf-) rechtliche Konsequenzen haben könnte.\n\n*4.6 Zahlungseingänge in verschiedenen Währungen.* Sie können Zahlungen in\neiner anderen Währung empfangen, auch wenn Sie diese Währung noch nicht in\nIhrem PayPal-Konto führen. In diesem Fall fragen wir Sie, ob Sie die\nZahlung akzeptieren oder ablehnen möchten, außer Sie haben in Ihrem Profil\nbereits eine Voreinstellung getroffen. Wenn Sie die Zahlung akzeptieren,\nführen Sie danach automatisch diese Währung in Ihrem PayPal-Konto.\n\nWenn Sie diese Währung bereits in Ihrem PayPal-Konto führen, schreiben wir\nIhnen den Betrag automatisch gut.\n\n*4.7 Steuern.* Sie sind für die korrekte Angabe und Abführung von Steuern\nverantwortlich. PayPal übernimmt keine Verantwortung für die Berechnung,\nMeldung oder Abführung von Steuern. Als Bankdienstleistung fällt auf unsere\nDienstleistung in der EU keine Umsatzsteuer an.\n\n*4.8 PayPal Business Payments.* Wenn Sie PayPal Business Payments in einem\nZahlungsvorgang einsetzen, dürfen Sie keine anderen PayPal Zahlungsoptionen\nin demselben Zahlungsvorgang anbieten.\n\n*5. Kontostand und Informationen über Zahlungsaufträge*\n\n*5.1 Guthaben und Informationen über Zahlungsaufträge.* Sie können Ihren\naktuellen PayPal-Kontostand jederzeit durch Einloggen in Ihr PayPal-Konto\neinsehen. Wesentliche Informationen zu Ihren Zahlungen erhalten Sie\naußerdem per E-Mail von uns.\n\nSie können sich auch einen Kontoauszug mit Informationen zu Zahlungen und\nGebühren herunterladen. Diesen Kontoauszug können Sie außerdem speichern,\nso dass Sie die Informationen jederzeit unverändert wieder abrufen können,\nz.B. indem Sie den Kontoauszug ausdrucken. Wir stellen Ihnen die Details zu\njeder Zahlung für einen Zeitraum von 13 Monaten online abrufbar zur\nVerfügung. Sofern Sie weitere Informationen zu Ihrem PayPal-Konto oder die\nKontoübersicht auf eine andere Art und Weise zur Verfügung gestellt\nbekommen, behält sich PayPal vor, dafür eine zusätzliche Gebühr zu\nverlangen.\n\nSie müssen kein Guthaben in Ihrem PayPal-Konto haben, um bezahlen zu\nkönnen. Wenn Sie Ihre PayPal-Zahlung mit Lastschrift, Kreditkarte, giropay\noder Banküberweisung abwickeln, erhalten Sie auf Ihrem PayPal-Konto ein\nE-Geld-Guthaben. Dieses leiten wir umgehend dem Zahlungsempfänger weiter.\nSie erhalten keine Zinsen auf Ihr Guthaben, da dieses Guthaben E-Geld und\nkeine Bankeinlage ist.\n\n*5.2 Negativer Kontostand.* Wenn Ihr PayPal-Kontostand im Minus ist, können\nSie kein Geld mit PayPal senden. Sie können Ihren Kontostand durch eine\nEinzahlung per Überweisung ausgleichen. Ansonsten hat PayPal folgende\nMöglichkeiten, einen negativen Kontostand auszugleichen:\n\n   - Wenn Zahlungen auf Ihrem PayPal-Konto eingehen, rechnen wir diese\n   automatisch auf.\n   - Bei Ihrer nächsten Kreditkartenzahlung bzw. Zahlung mit Lastschrift\n   belasten wir Ihre Kreditkarte bzw. Ihr Bankkonto zusätzlich zum\n   Zahlungsbetrag mit dem ausstehenden Betrag. Wir weisen Sie bei der Zahlung\n   darauf hin.\n   - Im Falle einer fehlgeschlagenen Lastschrift können wir Ihre\n   Kreditkarte belasten oder einen weiteren Versuch einer Lastschrift\n   unternehmen (siehe im Einzelnen Ziffer 3.7).\n   - Wenn Sie Guthaben in einer anderen Währung oder auf einem anderen\n   PayPal-Konto haben, können wir auch mit diesen Guthaben aufrechnen.\n   - Wir können den ausstehenden Betrag auch von einer bereits beantragten\n   Abbuchung auf Ihr Bankkonto abziehen.\n\nFalls der ausstehende Betrag in einer Fremdwährung besteht, rechnen wir\ndiesen nach Ablauf von 21 Tagen automatisch in Euro um. Es gelten\nWechselkurs und Gebühren gemäß Anhang 1 (Gebührenaufstellung).\n\n*5.3 Risiken bei Guthaben in verschiedenen Währungen.* Wenn Sie Guthaben in\nverschiedenen Währungen in Ihrem PayPal-Konto führen, haften Sie selbst für\ndie daraus entstehenden Risiken. Diese können zum Beispiel darin bestehen,\ndass sich der Wert Ihres Guthabens aufgrund von Wechselkursschwankungen\nerheblich vermindert.\n\nSie dürfen PayPal nicht für Währungsspekulationen nutzen.\n\n*5.4 Aufrechnung von Guthaben.* PayPal ist berechtigt, etwaige Gebühren,\nKosten oder sonstige uns geschuldete Beträge mit Ihrem Guthaben oder\nkünftigen Zahlungseingängen auf Ihrem PayPal-Konto aufzurechnen.\n\n*5.5 Pfandrecht.* Zur Sicherung aller bestehenden, zukünftigen und\nbedingten Ansprüche, die PayPal Ihnen gegenüber aus der Geschäftsbeziehung\nzustehen, stimmen Sie zu, dass PayPal an Ihrem PayPal-Guthaben sowie\nanderen Ihnen aus der Geschäftsverbindung zustehenden Ansprüchen ein\nPfandrecht erwirbt.\n\n*6. Abheben/Einlösen von E-Geld *\n\n*6.1 E-Geld auf Ihr Bankkonto abbuchen. Sie können Ihr PayPal-Guthaben auf\nIhr bei PayPal hinterlegtes Bankkonto abbuchen. Die Abbuchung von E-Geld\nvon Ihrem PayPal-Konto auf Ihr Bankkonto stellt eine Einlösung des E-Gelds\nin Euro dar. Veranlassen Sie die Abbuchung eines Guthabens in einer anderen\nWährung, gelten der Wechselkurs und die Gebühren gemäß Anhang 1\n(Gebührenaufstellung). *\n\n*6.2*\n*\n\n   1. Abhebelimit. Sie sind damit einverstanden, dass wir Ihre Identität\n   überprüfen, bevor wir Ihnen gegenüber E-Geld durch Abhebung einlösen\n   können. Das machen wir, um das Risiko von Betrug zu verringern und\n   Geldwäscherichtlinien und andere rechtliche Vorgaben einzuhalten. Etwaige\n   jährliche oder anderweitige periodische Abhebebeschränkungen können Sie\n   nach dem Einloggen in Ihr Konto unter \"Kontolimits\" auf der Seite \"Mein\n   Konto\" anzeigen lassen. \"Jährlich\" bezieht sich dabei auf das Kalenderjahr.\n   Im Rahmen unseres Risikomanagements können wir zusätzliche Limitierungen\n   vornehmen, um das Risiko von Zahlungsausfall und Betrug zu verringern.\n   2. Ausführungszeitpunkt. Wenn Sie E-Geld von Ihrem PayPal-Konto abheben\n   wollen, um es einzulösen, führen wir diesen Zahlungsauftrag innerhalb der\n   in Ziffer 3.1 genannten Frist aus. Wir können jedoch die Abhebung im Rahmen\n   unseres Risikomanagements und unserer gesetzlichen Verpflichtung zur\n   Verhinderung von Geldwäsche prüfen, sowie um festzustellen, ob eine der in\n   Ziffer 9 genannten verbotenen Aktivitäten ausgeführt wird. Wenn wir bei der\n   Abhebung ein Risiko nach den in Ziffer 10.5 (a) genannten Kriterien\n   feststellen, haben wir das Recht, das Zahlungsinstrument einzuschränken\n   oder Ihren Zahlungsauftrag abzulehnen.\n\n*\n\n*Wenn Sie uns einen Zahlungsauftrag zur Abhebung erteilen, gilt er an dem\nTag erteilt, an dem unsere Risikoprüfung gemäß Ziffer 10.5 (a)\nabgeschlossen ist. Am ersten Geschäftstag danach werden wir den\nZahlungsauftrag innerhalb der in Ziffer 3.1 genannten Frist ausführen. *\n\n*6.3 Abhebelimit aufheben. Sie können Ihr Abhebelimit aufheben, indem Sie\nIhr PayPal-Konto gemäß Ziffer 2.3 verifizieren.*\n\n*6.4 Abheben von Fremdwährungen. Sie können Guthaben in verschiedenen\nWährungen halten. Wenn Sie Guthaben in einer Fremdwährung abheben möchten,\nwird dieses jedoch immer in Euro umgerechnet, sofern Sie nicht mit uns eine\ngesonderte Vereinbarung getroffen haben.*\n\n*7. Vertragslaufzeit und Kontoschließung*\n\n*7.1 Vertragslaufzeit und PayPal-Konto schließen. *\nDiese Vereinbarung beginnt an dem Tag, an dem Sie Ihr PayPal-Konto\nerfolgreich eröffnet haben und dauert bis zu dem Zeitpunkt, an dem diese\nVereinbarung beendet wird. Vorbehaltlich von Ziffer 7.2 können Sie Ihr\nPayPal-Konto jederzeit über den entsprechenden Link in Ihrem Profil\nschließen und diese Vereinbarung kündigen. Bitte buchen Sie eventuelles\nGuthaben von Ihrem PayPal-Konto auf Ihr Bankkonto ab, bevor Sie Ihr\nPayPal-Konto schließen und diese Vereinbarung kündigen. Falls Sie noch\noffene Zahlungen in Ihrem PayPal-Konto haben, werden diese storniert.\nSollten Sie noch Gutscheine in Ihrem PayPal-Konto haben, für die Sie keine\nfinanzielle Gegenleistung erbracht haben, so verfallen diese mit der\nSchließung.\n\n*7.2 Einschränkungen bei der Kontoschließung.* Sie dürfen Ihr PayPal-Konto\nnicht schließen, um eine Kontoprüfung durch uns zu vermeiden.\n\nFalls Sie Ihr PayPal-Konto schließen, können wir Ihr Guthaben so lange\neinbehalten wie notwendig, um die in untenstehender Ziffer 10.5 (a)\nbeschriebenen Risiken bezüglich Ansprüchen auf Käuferschutz und\nangefochtenen Zahlungen zu minimieren. Wir werden die auf dem Konto\neinbehaltenen Beträge freigeben, sobald die relevanten Faktoren nicht mehr\nzutreffen. Auch nachdem Sie Ihr PayPal-Konto geschlossen haben, haften Sie\nweiterhin für sämtliche Forderungen im Zusammenhang mit Ihrem Konto und\nIhren Transaktionen.\n\n*7.3 Guthaben auf inaktiven Konten.* Grundsätzlich verfällt E-Geld auf\nPayPal-Konten nicht. Wenn Sie sich aber innerhalb von drei Jahren nicht in\nIhr PayPal-Konto einloggen, können wir dieses schließen. Sollten Sie\nGuthaben auf Ihrem inaktiven PayPal-Konto haben, können wir dieses an die\nin Ihrem Profil hinterlegten Bankdaten überweisen. Falls das nicht möglich\nist (beispielsweise weil Ihre Daten nicht mehr aktuell sind), können wir\ndas Geld für Sie entsprechend Luxemburger Recht (auf Ihre Kosten) bei\nder *Caisse\nde Consignation*, Trésorerie de l’Etat, 3, rue du St-Esprit, L-1475,\nLuxembourg, Tel: (+352) 2478-2478, Fax: (+352) 46 72 62. hinterlegen. Die\nanwendbaren Geschäftsbedingungen der Caisse de Consignation, insbesondere\ndiejenigen betreffend Steuern und Gebühren, können direkt bei der Caisse de\nConsignation, Trésorerie de l'Etat abgerufen werden. Es wird klargestellt,\ndass die Trésorerie de l’Etat, Caisse de Consignation, keine\nGeschäftseinheit von PayPal ist, sondern eine Abteilung des Luxemburger\nFinanzministeriums, die unter der Aufsicht des Luxemburger Finanzministers\nsteht. Bitte wenden Sie sich an den PayPal Kundendienst unter der auf den\nPayPal Internetseiten angegebenen Nummer, wenn Sie Fragen zu Guthaben\nhaben, die sich auf Ihrem Konto befunden haben, wenn es auf der Grundlage\ndieser Ziffer 7.3 geschlossen wurde.\n\n *8. Gebühren und Währungsumrechnung*\n\n*8.1 Gebühren.* Wir erheben für unsere Leistungen die in untenstehendem\nAnhang 1 (Gebührenaufstellung) beschriebenen nachfolgenden Gebühren von\nNutzern, die in Deutschland registriert sind. Anhang 1\n(Gebührenaufstellung) ist Teil dieser Vereinbarung. Zur Klarstellung weisen\nwir darauf hin, dass für Nutzer, deren PayPal-Konten in einem anderen Land\nregistriert sind, diejenigen Gebühren gelten, die sich aus den\nPayPal-Nutzungsbedingungen für dieses Land bzw. aus der Gebührentabelle\nergeben, auf die in der Fußzeile der PayPal-Website des Landes, in dem die\nNutzer registriert sind, verwiesen wird.\n\nSoweit zusätzliche Gebühren für im Anhang 1 (Gebührenaufstellung) nicht\ngenannte Serviceleistungen oder Funktionalitäten anfallen, werden Sie\nhierauf auf der jeweiligen PayPal-Website, auf der die Serviceleistungen\noder Funktionalitäten angeboten oder erbracht werden, gesondert hingewiesen.\n\n*8.2 Währungsumrechnung.* Wenn eine Zahlung eine Währungsumrechnung durch\nPayPal erfordert, wird diese zu einem Wechselkurs durchgeführt, der auf dem\nvon einem Finanzinstitut festgelegten Ankaufswechselkurs beruht, zu dem\nPayPal die Fremdwährung erwirbt. Der Wechselkurs wird regelmäßig unter\nBezugnahme auf die Marktbedingungen angepasst und unmittelbar ohne\nvorherige Benachrichtigung angewendet. Im Wechselkurs inbegriffen ist eine\nPayPal-Wechselkursgebühr in Form eines prozentualen Zuschlages auf den\nAnkaufwechselkurs.\n\nDie Wechselkursgebühren, die bei einem Währungsumtausch durch PayPal\nanfallen, sind in Anhang 1 (Gebührenaufstellung) genannt.\n\nDen aktuellen Ankaufwechselkurs können Sie im \"Währungsrechner\" in Ihrem\nPayPal-Konto jederzeit einsehen.\n\nWenn wir den Währungsumtausch durchführen, zeigen wir Ihnen den Wechselkurs\nan, bevor Sie den Zahlungsauftrag erteilen. Mit Ihrer Zahlung stimmen Sie\ndamit auch dem Währungsumtausch zum angezeigten Kurs zu. Wenn ein Händler\nin seinem Online-Shop beim Kauf einen Währungsumtausch anbietet und die\nWährungsumrechnung nicht durch PayPal durchgeführt wird, und Sie einen\nZahlungsauftrag erteilen, dann erfolgt der Umtausch durch den Händler zu\ndem vom Händler dafür angezeigten Kurs und etwaigen Gebühren. PayPal\nübernimmt Ihnen gegenüber für einen solchen Währungsumtausch durch den\nHändler keine Haftung.\n\nIndem Sie dieser Vereinbarung zustimmen, erklären Sie sich damit\neinverstanden, dass PayPal bei mit Kreditkarte finanzierten Zahlungen, die\neine Währungsumrechnung erfordern, die Währungsumrechnung anstelle Ihres\nKreditkartenunternehmens übernimmt. Wenn eine Transaktion mit Lastschrift\nfinanziert ist, so werden wir, sofern Sie nicht mit uns eine gesonderte\nVereinbarung getroffen haben, Ihr Bankkonto immer in Euro belasten und ggf.\neine Währungsumrechnung durchführen, falls dies zur Durchführung der\nTransaktion erforderlich ist.\n\n*9. Verbotene Aktivitäten *\n\n*9.1 Verbotene Aktivitäten.* Folgende Aktivitäten sind in Zusammenhang mit\nder Nutzung von PayPal verboten:\n a.Verstoß gegen die vorliegenden Nutzungsbedingungen, ein Credit Card\nProcessing Agreement, die\nPayPal-Nutzungsrichtlinie<https://email-edg.paypal.com/r/1O0QKGJ/D4ZK9T/IO6VRR/RNOTIQ/FXD756/7M/h>,\neine andere Richtlinie oder eine sonstige Vereinbarung, die Sie mit PayPal\nabgeschlossen haben. b.

Zulassen, dass Ihr\nPayPal-Konto dauerhaft einen negativen Kontostand aufweist. r. Tätigkeiten\nausführen, die ein Zahlungsausfall- oder Betrugsrisiko darstellen, die zu\neinem plötzlichen Anstieg des Risikos führen, oder die zu einem\ngesteigerten oder anderweitig nachteiligen Risikolevel führen (soweit\nPayPal aufgrund der vorliegenden Informationen vernünftigerweise davon\nausgehen kann). s.

Offenlegung von Daten eines anderen Nutzers gegenüber Dritten,\nWeitergabe der Daten an Dritte oder Nutzung solcher Daten für\nMarketingzwecke, es sei denn, der Nutzer hat Ihnen dies ausdrücklich\nerlaubt. v. Senden ungebetener E-Mails (Spam) an einen Nutzer, oder Nutzung\nvon PayPal, um Zahlungen für den Versand von unerbetenen E-Mails zu\nempfangen oder dabei zu helfen. w. eine Handlung vorzunehmen, die eine\nunzumutbare oder unverhältnismäßige Belastung unserer Betriebsmittel\ndarstellt. x. das Eindringen von Viren, Trojanern, Würmern oder sonstigen\nProgrammabläufen zu ermöglichen, die [Betriebs-]Systeme, Daten oder\nInformationen beschädigen, beeinträchtigen, heimlich abfangen oder außer\nKraft setzen; y. einen Such-Roboter, eine Spinne, eine sonstige\nautomatische Vorrichtung oder ein mechanisches Verfahren zur Überwachung\noder Vervielfältigung unserer Website ohne unsere vorherige schriftliche\nEinwilligung zu nutzen. z. Nutzung eines Geräts, Software oder eines\nProgrammablaufs, um unsere Robots-Exclusion-Kopfzeilen zu umgehen, oder\nunsere Webseite oder Dienstleistungen zu stören oder eine solche Störung zu\nversuchen. aa. Inhalte der PayPal-Website(s) ohne schriftliche Zustimmung\ndurch uns oder einen entsprechenden Dritten zu vervielfältigen,\nnachzubilden, an Dritte weiterzuleiten, zu verändern, umzugestalten,\nöffentlich zu machen, oder davon abgeleitete Bearbeitungen zu\nerstellen. ab. Handlungen,\ndie dazu führen können, dass unsere Internetdienstleister,\nZahlungsbearbeiter oder sonstige Zulieferer ihre Leistungen uns gegenüber\nnicht mehr erbringen. ac. Nutzung von PayPal, um das Kreditkartenverhalten\nzu testen. ad. Weitergabe Ihres Passworts an Dritte oder Verwendung des\nPassworts eines anderen Nutzers.

Vornehmen oder Unterlassen\nvon Maßnahmen oder Eingriffen, die den ordnungsgemäßen Betrieb von PayPal\ngemäß der vorliegenden Nutzungsbedingungen stören könnten, oder den Versuch\nzu unternehmen. af. Einbindung von PayPal als Zahlungsmethode auf eine\nWeise, die einen Kunden nicht erkennen lässt, ob er sich auf der PayPal\nWebseite befindet (Beispiel: iFraming, die URL ist für den Kunden nicht\nsichtbar). Wenn Sie verbotene Aktivitäten ausführen, gefährdet dies Ihren\nsicheren Zugang bzw. die Nutzung des Zahlungsinstruments, des PayPal-Kontos\nbzw. der PayPal-Dienstleistungen im Allgemeinen, ebenso wie Zugang und\nNutzung anderer Kunden. ag. Ebenso dürfen Sie nicht durch Ihre Nutzung\nPayPal der Gefahr aussetzen, in Widerspruch zu den Anti-Geldwäsche- und\nTerrorismusbekämpfungs-Verpflichtungen zu geraten (dies gilt auch für den\nFall, dass wir Ihre Identität nicht verifizieren können oder Sie die\nnotwendigen Schritte zur Freigabe Ihres Sende-, Empfangs- oder\nAbbuchungslimits in Übereinstimmung mit den Ziffern 3.1, 4.1 und 6.3 nicht\nvollständig ausführen).\n\n*9.2 Sicherheitsmaßnahmen für Ihr Zahlungsinstrument.* Sie müssen die\nfolgenden Sicherheitsmaßnahmen beachten, um Ihr Zahlungsinstrument zu\nschützen:\n\n   1. Beteiligen Sie sich nicht an Verbotenen Aktivitäten;\n   2. Verwahren Sie Ihre Zahlungsquellen und Passwörter sicher;\n   3. Ermöglichen Sie keinem Dritten den Zugang zu oder die Nutzung von\n   Ihren Zahlungsquellen oder Passwörtern;\n   4. Geben Sie keine geschützten Informationen zu Ihren Zahlungsquellen\n   oder Passwörtern preis, außer wenn Sie die PayPal Dienstleistung nutzen;\n   5. Vermeiden Sie es, Ihr Passwort so aufzuschreiben, dass es für andere\n   lesbar ist;\n   6. Wählen Sie kein Passwort, dass für Sie durch eine bestimmte\n   Reihenfolge von Zahlen oder Buchstaben einfach zu merken, aber auch leicht\n   zu erraten ist;\n   7. Achten Sie darauf, dass niemand Ihr Passwort sehen kann, wenn Sie es\n   eingeben;\n   8. Beachten Sie eventuelle sonstige Hinweise zum sicheren Umgang mit\n   Ihrem Zahlungsinstrument.\n\n\n *10. Zahlungsrisiken auf Verkäuferseite - Unsere Maßnahmen*\n\nPayPal stellt seine Dienste an Zahlungsempfänger zur Verfügung, um im\nRahmen ihrer geschäftlichen Angebote Zahlungen von Käufern an die\nZahlungsempfänger zu ermöglichen. Zusätzlich bietet PayPal Käufern den\nKäuferschutz an. Zahlungsempfänger profitieren von beiden Diensten in hohem\nGrade, da Zahlungen von Käufern durch PayPal einfacher und sicherer werden.\nUm solche Dienste an die Zahlungsempfänger zu erbringen, unter Wahrung der\nSicherheit und Integrität der Zahlungsdienste wozu PayPal gesetzlich\nverpflichtet ist, stellt PayPal folgendes System zur Verfügung:\n\n   - Falls eine Transaktion Ansprüchen auf Käuferschutz unterliegt oder\n   angefochten wird, und der Zahlungsempfänger nicht zum Verkäuferschutz\n   berechtigt ist, so ist der Zahlungsempfänger PayPal zur Erstattung\n   verpflichtet (Ziffer 10.1),\n   - Bei Transaktionen mit erhöhtem Risiko (Kriterien gemäß Ziffer 10.5)\n   kann PayPal die Zahlung einbehalten (Ziffer 10.5) oder ggf. Reserven auf\n   Ihrem Konto bilden (Ziffer 10.4).\n\n*10.1 Käuferbeschwerden oder Angefochtene Zahlungen auf Verkäuferseite. *\n\n   1. *Ansprüche und Angefochtene Transaktionen auf Verkäuferseite*\n   Falls PayPal in Bezug auf Ihre Transaktionen Kenntnis von:\n      - Rücklastschriften\n      - Kreditkartenrückbuchungen\n      - Gebühren, Vertragsstrafen und Bußgeldern\n      - Sonstigem Schaden, der PayPal, einem Nutzer von PayPal oder einem\n      Dritten durch Ihre Nutzung von PayPal und/oder einen Verstoß gegen die\n      Nutzungsbedingungen entsteht\n\n   erhält, so sind Sie verpflichtet, die Aufwendungen in den oben genannten\n   Fällen zu ersetzen. Ihr Recht, unter der Verkäuferschutzrichtlinie\n   Ansprüche geltend zu machen, soweit die Voraussetzungen gegeben sind,\n   bleibt unberührt.\n    2. *Sie haften für berechtigte Anträge auf Käuferschutz und\n   Käuferbeschwerden.* Wenn PayPal aufgrund eines Antrags auf Käuferschutz\n   oder einer Käuferbeschwerde gemäß der Käufer- bzw.\n   Verkäuferschutzrichtlinie zugunsten des Käufers entscheidet, sind Sie\n   verpflichtet, PayPal den Kaufpreis sowie die ursprünglichen Versandkosten\n   (auch wenn Sie in manchen Fällen den Artikel nicht zurückerhalten) zu\n   ersetzen. Detaillierte Angaben dazu, welche Auswirkungen der PayPal\n   Käuferschutz auf Sie als Verkäufer haben kann, finden Sie unter\n   nachstehender Ziffer 13.2 sowie in der PayPal-Käuferschutzrichtlinie.\n   3. *Umsetzung der Ausgleichsverpflichtung für Käuferschutzanträge,\n   angefochtene Zahlungen und andere Beträge. * Ihre Verbindlichkeiten\n   gegenüber PayPal, die aus einer der oben beschriebenen Haftungsgründe\n   entstehen, können wir unmittelbar durch Einzug von einem etwaigen Guthaben\n   auf Ihrem PayPal-Konto ausgleichen. Wenn Sie kein Guthaben auf Ihrem\n   PayPal-Konto haben, können wir eingehende Zahlungen zum Ausgleich nutzen\n   oder mit Ihnen einen anderen Weg der Bezahlung vereinbaren. PayPal kann\n   dazu auch den Rechtsweg beschreiten und gegebenenfalls ein\n   Inkassounternehmen einschalten.\n   4. *Vorübergehende Zugriffsbeschränkung bei angefochtenen\nZahlungen.*Wenn ein Käufer einen Käuferschutzantrag stellt, eine\n   Kreditkartenrückbuchung oder eine Rücklastschrift einreicht, behält PayPal\n   vorübergehend auf Ihrem PayPal-Konto einen Betrag in Höhe des\n   Gesamtbetrages der angefochtenen Zahlung ein. Ein Einbehalt nach dieser\n   Bestimmung schränkt jedoch nicht die Verfügbarkeit Ihres Kontos im Hinblick\n   auf andere, nicht angefochtene bzw. aufgrund eines Käuferschutzantrags,\n   einer Kreditkartenrückbuchung oder einer Rücklastschrift gefährdete Beträge\n   ein. Wenn Sie in dem Streit gewinnen oder die Voraussetzungen für den\n   Verkäuferschutz gemäß der PayPal-Verkäuferschutzrichtlinie erfüllt sind,\n   heben wir die Beschränkung auf und Sie können über den Betrag wieder\n   verfügen. Sollten Sie verlieren, wird PayPal den Betrag von Ihrem\n   PayPal-Konto abbuchen. Dieser Vorgang findet auch auf Schutzanträge\n   Anwendung, die der Käufer bei eBay über das dortige Konfliktlösungsportal\n   gestellt und über die eBay uns informiert hat.\"\n\n*10.2 Maßnahmen von PayPal.* Falls für uns der begründete Verdacht besteht,\ndass Sie gegen eines der Verbote in Ziffer 9 verstoßen haben, dürfen wir\nMaßnahmen einleiten, die PayPal, einen betroffenen Nutzer, Dritte oder Sie\nselbst vor der in 10.1 genannten Haftung schützen. Wir können unter anderem\nfolgende Maßnahmen treffen:\n\n   1. Ihr Recht, das Zahlungsinstrument oder das PayPal-Konto zu nutzen,\n   ausschließen, aussetzen oder einschränken. Dies kann für das gesamte\n   PayPal-Konto gelten oder für einzelne Zahlungsvorgänge. Beispielsweise\n   können wir die Nutzung einer Ihrer Zahlungsquellen beschränken oder die\n   Möglichkeit, Geld zu senden, Abhebungen vorzunehmen oder Finanzdaten zu\n   entfernen. Grundsätzlich informieren wir Sie über solche Maßnahmen im\n   Voraus. Wir können Ihr Recht, das Zahlungsinstrument bzw. Ihr PayPal-Konto\n   zu nutzen aber auch ohne vorherige Mitteilung ausschließen, aussetzen oder\n   einschränken, wenn wir dies zum Beispiel aus Sicherheitsgründen für\n   notwendig halten oder Sie diese Vereinbarung verletzt haben.\n   2. Ihr PayPal-Konto sperren und/oder Guthaben auf Ihrem Reservekonto\n   einbehalten. (Dies gilt, ohne Beschränkungen darauf, für mehr als 180 Tage,\n   soweit dies von PayPal benötigt wird und soweit das Recht nach Ziffer 10.2\n   aus einer verbotenen Aktivität gemäß Ziffer 9.1 ag herrührt)\n   3. Die Ausführung einer bestimmten Zahlung ablehnen. Auf Anfrage teilen\n   wir Ihnen die Tatsache der Ablehnung, den Grund und mögliche Lösungswege\n   mit, sofern uns dies nicht rechtlich untersagt ist.\n   4. Eine Zahlung zurückbuchen, wenn ein Verstoß gegen die\n   Nutzungsrichtlinie oder Ziffer 9 vorliegt oder wir den begründeten Verdacht\n   dazu haben.\n   5. Entsprechend unseren Datenschutzgrundsätzen Informationen über\n   verbotene Aktivitäten Dritten offenlegen.\n   6. Weitere Informationen von Ihnen anfragen oder auf anderem Weg\n   unzutreffende Angaben, die Sie uns gegenüber gemacht haben, richtigstellen.\n   7. Die zukünftige Nutzung von PayPal untersagen.\n   8. Wir können Ihr Guthaben, solange wie dies vernünftigerweise notwendig\n   ist, einbehalten, um uns gegen ein Haftungsrisiko zu schützen. Sie erkennen\n   dies insbesondere in den folgenden, nicht abschließend geregelten, Fällen\n   an:\n      1. Das Haftungsrisiko von PayPal bei von Ihnen empfangenen Zahlungen,\n      für die als Zahlungsquelle eine Kreditkarte benutzt wurde, dauert an, bis\n      das Risiko einer Rückbuchung zugunsten des Zahlenden/Käufers (wie in den\n      Kreditkartenregelungen festgelegt) nicht mehr besteht. Dies beruht auf\n      unterschiedlichen Faktoren, einschließlich aber nicht abschließend:\n         1. Die Art der Waren oder Dienstleistungen, für die Sie eine\n         Zahlung erhalten haben, oder\n         2. Die Zeitspanne, die Sie für die Lieferung der Waren oder die\n         Erbringung der Dienstleistung benötigen, für die Sie die\nZahlung erhalten\n         haben (z.B. kann der Verkauf von Veranstaltungskarten Monate\nvor dem Datum\n         der Veranstaltung zu einem höheren und länger andauerndem\nRisiko führen als\n         der Verkauf der meisten anderen Waren oder Dienstleistungen).\n       2. PayPals Risiko in Zusammenhang mit Schutzanträgen oder\n      Konflikten, die aus einer von Ihnen empfangenen Zahlung herrühren, dauert\n      so lange an, wie die Parteien benötigen, um den Schutzantrag\noder Konflikt\n      und alle damit zusammenhängenden Beschwerden in Übereinstimmung\nmit Ziffer\n      13 dieser Bedingungen zu schließen.\n      3. PayPals Haftungsrisiko in Zusammenhang mit einer möglichen\n      Insolvenz von Ihnen besteht so lange, wie PayPal durch anwendbare Gesetze\n      gehindert wird Ansprüche gerichtlich durchzusetzen.\n      4. Soweit Sie zulassen, dass sich Ihr Konto im Minus befindet, dauert\n      PayPals Haftungsrisiko so lange an, wie sich Ihr Konto im Minus befindet.\n\n\n   1. Informationen und Dokumente zur Verifizierung Ihrer Person und/oder\n   der einer Zahlung zugrunde liegenden Leistung von Ihnen verlangen.\n\nSie dürfen Ihr Zahlungsinstrument oder Ihr PayPal-Konto nicht nutzen, wenn\nIhr Nutzungsrecht ausgeschlossen, ausgesetzt oder eingeschränkt wurde. Sie\nsind in diesem Fall dazu verpflichtet, Ihre mit Händlern oder Dritten\ngetroffenen Vereinbarungen über Einzugsermächtigungen sofort zu kündigen.\nSie haften auch nach einer Ausschließung, Aussetzung oder Einschränkung für\nGebühren oder andere Verbindlichkeiten, die durch Ihre Nutzung des\nPayPal-Kontos entstehen.\n\n*10.3 Kontoschließung und eingeschränkter Zugriff.* Wir können diese\nVereinbarung mit Ihnen jederzeit mit einer Kündigungsfrist von zwei Monaten\nkündigen und Ihr PayPal-Konto schließen, oder unsere Geschäftsbeziehung nur\nim Hinblick einzelne optionale Teile unserer Diente beenden. Wenn ein\nwichtiger Grund vorliegt, der für uns die Fortsetzung unserer\nVertragsbeziehung auch unter Berücksichtigung Ihrer berechtigten Belange\nunzumutbar macht, können wir unsere Geschäftsbeziehung jederzeit fristlos\nganz oder teilweise kündigen und Ihr PayPal-Konto schließen.\n\nSoweit der wichtige Grund in der Verletzung einer vertraglichen Pflicht\nliegt, so kündigen wir nur nach erfolglosem Ablauf einer zur Abhilfe\nbestimmten angemessenen Frist bzw. Abmahnung; die Frist bzw. Abmahnung kann\njedoch aufgrund besonderer Umstände des Einzelfalls entfallen, etwa wenn\nSie die Erfüllung der vertraglichen Pflichten ernsthaft und endgültig\nverweigern, oder wenn sonstige besondere Umstände vorliegen, die unter\nAbwägung der beiderseitigen Interessen die sofortige Kündigung\nrechtfertigen.\n\nIn diesem Fall benachrichtigen wir Sie und geben Ihnen die Möglichkeit,\nsämtliche unstreitigen Beträge abzuheben. Falls wir vermuten, dass ein\nZugriff auf Ihr Konto ohne Ihre Zustimmung erfolgt ist, können wir den\nZugang zu Ihrem Konto oder den PayPal-Dienstleistungen aussetzen oder\nbeschränken (wie z.B. den Zugang zu Ihren Zahlungsquellen und die\nMöglichkeit, Geld zu senden, beschränken, Abbuchungen durchzuführen oder\ndie Möglichkeit, finanzielle Informationen zu entfernen).\n\nSollten wir den Zugriff auf Ihr PayPal-Konto einschränken, werden wir Sie\nentsprechend benachrichtigen und Ihnen die Gelegenheit geben, die\nWiederherstellung des unbeschränkten Zugriffs zu verlangen.\n\n*10.4 Reserven.* PayPal kann aus Ihrem Guthaben auf Ihrem PayPal-Konto eine\nReserve bilden.\n\nDas geschieht dann, wenn wir aufgrund uns zur Verfügung stehender\nInformationen berechtigterweise zu der Einschätzung kommen, dass im\nZusammenhang mit Ihrem PayPal-Konto aufgrund Ihrer finanziellen Situation\nund aufgrund der in Ziffer 10.5(a) genannten Kriterien ein erhöhtes Risiko\nfür uns besteht, einschließlich eines Ausfallrisikos gemäß Ziffer 10.1.\n\nDas bedeutet: Ein bestimmter Teil Ihres Guthabens oder Ihrer eingehenden\nZahlungen wird auf Ihr Reservekonto gebucht und erscheint als \"nicht\nverfügbar\" in Ihrer Kontoübersicht. Über dieses Guthaben können Sie nicht\nunmittelbar verfügen.\n\nWenn wir eine Reserve bilden, teilen wir Ihnen die genauen Bedingungen\ndafür mit. Die Bedingungen können zum Beispiel so aussehen:\n\n   - Wir behalten als Reserve einen bestimmten Prozentsatz der empfangenen\n   Zahlungen über einen bestimmten Zeitraum ein (dynamische Reserve).\n   - Wir behalten einen Fixbetrag in Ihrem Konto ein (Mindestreserve).\n\nDie Bedingungen richten sich danach, was wir für notwendig erachten, um die\nmit Ihrem PayPal-Konto verbundenen Risiken zu minimieren. Wir können die\nBedingungen ändern, sofern wir Ihnen die Änderungen mitteilen. Wenn Sie mit\nder Bildung einer Reserve nicht einverstanden sind, können Sie Ihr\nPayPal-Konto schließen. Wenn Ihr PayPal-Konto, gleich aus welchem Grund,\ngeschlossen wird, können wir gemäß Ziffer 7.2 eine Reserve nicht länger als\nnötig einbehalten.\n\nAls Teil unseres Risikomanagements können wir auch folgende Maßnahmen für\nAbbuchungen von Geld auf Ihr Bankkonto ergreifen:\n\n   - Den Betrag begrenzen, den Sie von Ihrem PayPal-Konto unmittelbar\n   abheben können.\n   - Die Auszahlungsgeschwindigkeit oder Auszahlungsform ändern.\n   - Eine Aufrechnung mit Ihrem Guthaben vornehmen und/oder Sie oder eine\n   mit Ihnen verbundene Person dazu auffordern, Vereinbarungen mit uns über\n   Sicherheiten zu treffen (zum Beispiel eine Garantie abzugeben oder\n   Sicherheiten für Ihre Verbindlichkeiten bei uns oder Dritten zu\n   hinterlegen). Sie sind verpflichtet, die dazu gegebenenfalls notwendigen\n   Schritte und Maßnahmen auf Ihre Kosten zu ergreifen, um die Bildung einer\n   Reserve oder einer anderen Sicherheit zu unseren Gunsten rechtswirksam zu\n   ermöglichen.\n\n*10.5 Vorübergehend einbehaltene Zahlungen*\n\n   1. PayPal kann eine Zahlung, die Sie erhalten, oder eine damit im\n   Zusammenhang stehende Zahlung einbehalten, wenn nach unseren internen\n   Risikomodellen ein Risiko nach den nachfolgenden Kriterien besteht.. PayPal\n   wird die Zahlung nicht länger als nötig einbehalten und wird auf\n   regelmäßiger Basis überprüfen, ob die identifizierten Risikofaktoren noch\n   auf das Konto zutreffen. Sobald dies nicht mehr der Fall ist, werden wir\n   die Zahlung entsprechend freigeben.\n\n   PayPal kann Zahlungen einbehalten, um die Sicherheit und Integrität des\n   Zahlungsdienstes aufrechtzuerhalten. Diese Maßnahme umfasst Einbehalte von\n   Zahlungen, um den Verdacht auf Rechtsverstöße, Betrugsrisiken, und\n   Compliance-Probleme im Zusammenhang mit einer Zahlung zu minimieren, und um\n   alle Nutzer des Zahlungsdienstes und uns selbst gegen Risiken des\n   Missbrauchs unserer Dienste sowie gegen Zahlungsausfall wegen der Risiken\n   gemäß Ziffer 10.1 zu schützen. Wir nutzen die nachfolgenden Kriterien zur\n   Evaluierung der Risiken (jeweils allein oder gemeinsam mit anderen\n   Kriterien):\n    - Die Transaktion ist mit einem erhöhten Risiko verbunden, weil Güter\n      einer hohen Risikokategorie verkauft werden, oder weil uns weitere\n      Tatsachen bekannt sind, die typischerweise zu einer erhöhten Anzahl von\n      Kreditkartenrückbuchungen, sonstigen Beschwerden oder Konflikten führen\n      oder die oft in Betrug oder illegaler Aktivität verwickelt sind.\n      - Das Verkaufsverhalten eines Kontoinhabers weist plötzliche und\n      anormale Änderungen auf, einschließlich eines Anstiegs der Anzahl der\n      Kreditkartenrückbuchungen, Rückbuchungen oder Käuferbeschwerden bezüglich\n      dieses Kontos.\n      - Wir haben Grund zu dem Verdacht, dass das Konto oder die\n      Zahlungsquelle für Verbotene Aktivitäten (wie in Ziffer 9 beschrieben)\n      genutzt werden.\n      - Wir haben Grund zu der Annahme, dass unberechtigt auf ein PayPal\n      Konto zugegriffen wurde, das im Zusammenhang mit der Transaktion benutzt\n      wurde, oder dass gestohlene Bankdaten (Kontodaten oder Kreditkartendaten)\n      für die Zahlung genutzt wurden oder eine Transaktion sonst nicht\n      ordnungsgemäß autorisiert wurde,\n      - Wir haben Grund zu der Annahme, dass ein Nutzer versucht, auf\n      betrügerische oder verbotene Weise erhaltene Beträge zu senden oder\n      abzuheben,\n      - Ein Nutzer hat nicht genügend Informationen zur Verfügung gestellt,\n      die uns in die Lage versetzen, seine Identität oder die seines Geschäftes\n      zu überprüfen, und/oder der Nutzer hat nur beschränkte\nVerkaufshistorie auf\n      PayPal oder eBay.\n   2. Sie erklären sich damit einverstanden, dass PayPal die einbehaltene\n   Zahlung in Ihrem Reservekonto hält und dass Sie PayPal die zur Beurteilung\n   des Risikos notwendigen Informationen zur Verfügung stellen werden.\n\n*10.6 Vorübergehend einbehaltene Zahlungen auf eBay*\n\n   1. PayPal kann eine Zahlung, die Sie für einen Verkauf auf eBay erhalten\n   vorübergehend einbehalten, wenn nach unserer Einschätzung bei dieser\n   Zahlung ein höheres Risiko besteht. Wir halten die Zahlung dann solange in\n   Ihrem Reservekonto, bis unserer Einschätzung nach dieses Risiko nicht mehr\n   besteht. Wenn eine Zahlung vorübergehend einbehalten wird, wird Ihnen dies\n   in Ihrem PayPal-Konto angezeigt.\n   2. Spätestens nach 21 Tagen geben wir die Zahlung frei, so dass Sie in\n   Ihrem Zahlungskonto zur Verfügung steht. Die gilt nur dann nicht, wenn\n   zwischenzeitlich für diese Zahlung eine Rücklastschrift,\n   Kreditkartenrückbuchung oder ein Antrag auf Käuferschutz eingegangen ist.\n   PayPal kann die Zahlung auch vor Ablauf von 21 Tagen freigeben, wenn der\n   Käufer auf eBay eine positive Feedbackbewertung abgibt.\n   3. Sollte die vorübergehend einbehaltene Zahlung von einer\n   Rücklastschrift, Kreditkartenbuchung oder einem Antrag auf Käuferschutz\n   betroffen sein, können wir die Zahlung bzw. einen entsprechenden Betrag in\n   Ihrem Reservekonto solange einbehalten, bis eine Klärung herbeigeführt ist.\n\n*10.7 Zusätzliche Informationen für unser Risikomanagement und zur\nGeldwäscheprävention.* Für unser Risikomanagement und um die gesetzlichen\nAnforderungen der Geldwäscheprävention zu erfüllen, kann es sein, dass wir\nzusätzliche Informationen über Sie bzw. Ihr Unternehmen von Ihnen\nbenötigen. Sie sind verpflichtet, uns auf Anfrage auf Ihre Kosten\nzusätzliche Informationen über die finanzielle Situation und den Betrieb\nIhres Gewerbes oder Unternehmens zur Verfügung zu stellen, wie zum Beispiel\nJahresabschlüsse (testiert oder in sonstiger Form geprüft), Aufstellungen\nanderer Zahlungsdienstleister, Registerauszüge oder Ausweiskopien.\n\n*11. PayPal-Verkäuferschutz *\n\nPayPal bietet Verkäuferschutz gemäß der\nVerkäuferschutzrichtlinie<https://email-edg.paypal.com/r/1O0QKGJ/D4ZK9T/IO6VRR/RNOTIQ/9ZM0VH/7M/h>.\nDie Verkäuferschutzrichtlinie ist Bestandteil dieser Nutzungsbedingungen.\n\n*12. Bearbeitungsfehler und unberechtigte Zahlungen*\n\n*12.1 Ermittlung von Bearbeitungsfehlern und/oder unberechtigten\nZahlungen.*Sie können sämtliche Zahlungsvorgänge jederzeit einsehen,\nindem Sie sich in\nIhr PayPal-Konto einloggen. Bitte benachrichtigen Sie uns umgehend, falls\nSie den Verdacht haben, dass einer der folgenden Fälle eingetreten ist:\n\n   1. Jemand hat unberechtigterweise eine Zahlung von Ihrem PayPal-Konto\n   gesendet.\n   2. Jemand hat sich unberechtigt in Ihr PayPal-Konto eingeloggt.\n   3. Ihr PayPal-Passwort ist jemand anderem bekannt und/oder Ihr\n   Sicherheitsschlüssel ist verloren gegangen oder wurde gestohlen.\n   4. Jemand hat ohne Ihre Zustimmung Geld von Ihrem PayPal-Konto abgehoben\n   oder könnte eine solche Abbuchung vornehmen.\n\nDiese Fälle werden im Folgenden als *\"unberechtigter\nPayPal-Kontozugriff\"*bezeichnet. Bitte benachrichtigen Sie uns auch,\nwenn Sie glauben, dass ein\nanderer Fehler in Ihrem PayPal-Konto aufgetreten ist.\n\nSie sollten Ihr PayPal-Konto regelmäßig darauf hin überprüfen. Wir werden\nSie nicht für einen unberechtigten PayPal-Kontozugriff haftbar machen, es\nsei denn, uns liegen Beweise vor, dass Sie jemandem vorsätzlich oder grob\nfahrlässig Zugang zu Ihrem PayPal-Konto verschafft haben oder Sie die in\ndieser Vereinbarung genannten Sicherheitsmaßnahmen für Ihr\nZahlungsinstrument vorsätzlich oder grob fahrlässig nicht eingehalten\nhaben.\n\n*12.2 Mitteilung an PayPal über Bearbeitungsfehler, unberechtigte Zahlungen\nund/oder die unberechtigte Nutzung Ihres Zahlungsinstruments.* Wenn Sie\nglauben, dass ein Bearbeitungsfehler, eine unberechtigte Zahlung oder eine\nunberechtigte Nutzung Ihres Zahlungsinstruments vorliegt, sind Sie\nverpflichtet uns auf eine der folgenden Weisen zu benachrichtigen:\n\n   - Rufen Sie unseren Kundenservice an. Unsere Service-Telefonnummer\n   finden Sie auf der Seite \"Kontakt\".\n   - Füllen Sie direkt auf unserer Website das\nFormular<https://email-edg.paypal.com/r/1O0QKGJ/D4ZK9T/IO6VRR/RNOTIQ/BM4VA8/7M/h>aus.\n   - Schreiben Sie uns: PayPal, Error Resolution Department, 22–24\n   Boulevard Royal, L-2449 Luxemburg.\n\nFalls Sie uns telefonisch benachrichtigen, können wir Sie bitten, Ihre\nAnfrage innerhalb von 10 Werktagen zusätzlich schriftlich einzureichen.\nBitte füllen Sie das Formular aus, und senden Sie es online oder auf dem\nPostweg an PayPal, Error Resolution Department, 22–24 Boulevard Royal,\nL-2449 Luxemburg.\n\nSie sind verpflichtet, uns die Ihnen verfügbaren Informationen über die\nUmstände eines Bearbeitungsfehlers, einer unberechtigten Zahlung und/oder\neiner unberechtigten Nutzung Ihres Zahlungsinstruments oder PayPal-Kontos\nzu geben und uns bei einer Untersuchung zu unterstützen.\n\n*12.3 Prüfung von Meldungen über Bearbeitungsfehler.* Wir werden Sie\ninnerhalb von 20 Geschäftstagen nach Eingang Ihrer Meldung über das\nErgebnis unserer Prüfung informieren. Sollte uns ein Bearbeitungsfehler\nunterlaufen sein, so werden wir diesen unverzüglich korrigieren.\n\nUnter Umständen kann unsere Prüfung mehr Zeit erfordern und bis zu 60 Tage\ndauern. Sollte dies der Fall sein, werden wir den fraglichen Betrag nach\nEingang Ihrer Meldung innerhalb von 10 Geschäftstagen Ihrem PayPal-Konto\nvorbehaltlich gutschreiben. So können Sie über das entsprechende E-Geld\nverfügen, während wir den Fall prüfen.\n\nFalls Sie uns zunächst telefonisch benachrichtigt haben und uns Ihre\nAnfrage danach nicht innerhalb von 10 Geschäftstagen schriftlich zugeht,\nsind wir nicht verpflichtet, den fraglichen Betrag Ihrem PayPal-Konto\nvorbehaltlich gutzuschreiben.\n\nNach Abschluss unserer Prüfung benachrichtigen wir Sie innerhalb von drei\nGeschäftstagen über das Ergebnis. Falls wir ermittelt haben, dass kein\nIrrtum vorlag, werden wir Ihnen eine schriftliche Erläuterung zusenden und\nkönnen den Ihrem PayPal-Konto zuvor im Zusammenhang mit der Annahme eines\nIrrtums vorläufig gutgeschriebenen Betrag wieder abbuchen. Sie können\nKopien der von uns im Zuge unserer Untersuchung verwendeten Unterlagen\nanfordern.\n\n*12.4 Haftung für unberechtigte Zahlungen.* Falls Sie uns einen\nunberechtigten PayPal-Kontozugriff melden und es keinen Nachweis für einen\nBetrug oder anderes vorsätzliches oder grob fahrlässiges Verhalten gibt,\nwerden wir Ihnen den vollständigen Betrag aller von Ihrem PayPal-Konto aus\nunberechtigt getätigten Zahlungen erstatten.\n\nDies setzt voraus, dass Sie uns unverzüglich und spätestens 13 Monate nach\ndem ersten unberechtigten PayPal-Kontozugriff darüber informiert haben.\nWenn wir eine weitere Prüfung der Umstände für notwendig halten, werden wir\ndas in Ziffer 12.3 beschriebene Prüfungsverfahren anwenden.\n\n*12.5 Ihr Erstattungsanspruch.* Sie haben das Recht, jede Zahlung, für die\nSie eine wirksame Ermächtigung erteilt haben und die durch Sie oder einen\nHändler bzw. einen Dritten ausgelöst wird, vollständig erstattet zu\nbekommen, wenn die in Ziffer 3.10 genannten Voraussetzungen für eine\nRückbuchung erfüllt sind.\n\n*12.6 Bearbeitungsfehler.* Sollten wir einen Bearbeitungsfehler entdecken,\nso werden wir diesen richtig stellen.\n\nFalls der Bearbeitungsfehler dazu führte, dass Sie weniger Geld erhalten\nhaben, als Ihnen zustand, so werden wir Ihrem PayPal-Konto den\nDifferenzbetrag gutschreiben.\n\nFalls irrtümlicherweise eine Gutschrift auf Ihr Bankkonto oder Ihre\nKreditkarte erfolgte, so kann PayPal diesen Fehler durch Abbuchen von der\nentsprechenden Zahlungsquelle berichtigen.\n\nFalls der Bearbeitungsfehler dazu führte, dass eine Zahlung durch uns nicht\nrechtzeitig oder nicht über den richtigen Betrag ausgeführt wurde,\nerstatten wir den Fehlbetrag, der durch die nicht rechtzeitige oder nicht\nausgeführte Zahlung entstanden ist. Wir haften in diesem Fall außerdem für\nIhre vorhersehbaren Schäden und Verluste, die Ihnen direkt und unmittelbar\naus der nicht erfolgten Zahlung entstanden sind. Das gilt jedoch nicht für\nfolgende Fälle:\n\n   1. Sie hatten ohne unser Verschulden kein ausreichendes Guthaben, um die\n   Zahlung abzuschließen.\n   2. Unser System funktionierte nicht ordnungsgemäß, und Sie waren sich\n   des Systemausfalls bewusst, als Sie die Zahlung einleiteten.\n   3. Umstände außerhalb unseres Einflussbereichs (wie beispielsweise\n   Brand, Hochwasser oder Ausfall der Internetverbindung) haben die\n   Durchführung der Zahlung trotz angemessener Vorsichtsmaßnahmen von uns\n   verhindert.\n\nAbweichend davon haftet PayPal nicht für nicht ausgeführte Zahlungen oder\nfehlerhaft ausgeführte Zahlungen (gleich ob von Ihnen oder einem andere\nPayPal-Kunden veranlasst), wenn Sie PayPal nicht unverzüglich, nachdem Sie\nden Fehler bemerken, spätestens aber 13 Monate nach Wertstellung, darüber\nbenachrichtigen.\n\n*13. PayPal-Käuferschutz*\n\n*13.1 Kauf.* PayPal bietet nach Maßgabe der\nPayPal-Käuferschutzrichtlinie<https://email-edg.paypal.com/r/1O0QKGJ/D4ZK9T/IO6VRR/RNOTIQ/KE9XDM/7M/h>einen\nSchutz für Käufe an, die mit PayPal bezahlt werden. Die\nPayPal-Käuferschutzrichtlinie wird hiermit Bestandteil dieser\nNutzungsbedingungen.\n\n*13.2 Haftung des Verkäufers.* Sollte PayPal den Antrag des Käufers für\nberechtigt halten, so hat der Zahlungsempfänger hierfür entsprechend\neinzustehen. Dies gilt auch, wenn ein Käufer mit einem ausländischen\nPayPal-Konto einen Antrag auf Käuferschutz stellt und dieser Antrag von der\nam ausländischen Ort der Kontenregistrierung anwendbaren\nKäuferschutzrichtlinie umfasst ist.\n\nSollte PayPal den Antrag des Käufers für berechtigt halten, buchen wir den\nZahlungsbetrag zurück auf das PayPal-Konto des Käufers, sofern das\nPayPal-Konto des Zahlungsempfängers zu diesem Zeitpunkt ein Guthaben\naufweist. Sollte kein Guthaben vorhanden sein, kann PayPal die Verfügung\ndes Zahlungsempfängers über sein PayPal-Konto beschränken. Der Käufer hat\nauf diese Leistung von PayPal aber keinen Anspruch. Die Haftung des\nZahlungsempfängers gemäß Ziffer 10.1 wird hierdurch nicht begrenzt.\n\n*13.3 Abtretung.* Für den Fall, dass PayPal Ihnen aufgrund eines Antrags\nauf Käuferschutz, einer Käuferbeschwerde, einer Rücklastschrift oder einer\nKreditkartenrückbuchung den entsprechenden Betrag auszahlt, treten Sie\nhiermit vorsorglich als Käufer Ihre Ansprüche gegenüber dem Empfänger der\nZahlung in Zusammenhang mit dem strittigen Zahlungsvorgang an PayPal ab.\n\n*14. Konflikte mit PayPal *\n\n*14.1 Direkte Benachrichtigung von PayPal.* Sollte ein Konflikt zwischen\nIhnen und PayPal auftreten, so ist uns daran gelegen, von Ihrem Anliegen zu\nerfahren und darauf einzugehen sowie, falls wir nicht in der Lage sein\nsollten, dies zu Ihrer Zufriedenheit zu tun, Ihnen eine neutrale und\nkostengünstige Form der schnellen Streitbeilegung zu bieten. Wenden Sie\nsich hierfür telefonisch oder online über die Funktion \"Schreiben Sie uns\neine E-Mail\" auf der\n\"Kontakt<https://email-edg.paypal.com/r/1O0QKGJ/D4ZK9T/IO6VRR/RNOTIQ/WLHNPJ/7M/h>\"-Seite\nan unseren Kundenservice.\n\n*14.2 ECC-Net, Ombudsmann für Finanzfragen und CSSF.* Wenn Sie sich mit\nIhrer Beschwerde an eine Schlichtungsstelle oder die Bankaufsicht wenden\nmöchten, stehen Ihnen die folgenden Institutionen zur Verfügung:\n\n   1.

Im\nFalle von Beschwerden, die nicht anderweitig beigelegt werden können, haben\nenglische Gerichte eine nicht-ausschließliche Zuständigkeit. Das bedeutet,\nSie können in England klagen, können aber auch einen anderen Gerichtsstand\nwählen. Ihre deutschen Verbraucherschutzrechte sowie Ihr Recht,\ngerichtliche Verfahren vor Luxemburger Gerichten einzuleiten, bleiben von\ndieser Regelung unberührt.\n\n*14.4 Kein Verzicht.* Sollten wir es unterlassen, im Hinblick auf einen\nVerstoß oder einer Pflichtverletzung durch Sie oder Dritte zu reagieren, so\nstellt dies keinen Verzicht auf unser Recht dar, im Falle anschließender\noder vergleichbarer Verstöße Maßnahmen zu ergreifen.\n\n*14.6 Haftungsbeschränkung. *Wir haften Ihnen gegenüber nur für Verluste\noder Schäden, die unmittelbar oder nach vernünftigem Ermessen in\nvorhersehbarer Weise durch eine Verletzung der vorliegenden Vereinbarung\nverursacht werden, und unsere Haftung unter diesen Umständen ist in der im\nFolgenden in dieser Ziffer dargestellten Weise wie folgt beschränkt:\n\n   1. Wir bzw. die mit uns verbundenen Unternehmen, unsere Vertreter\n   und/oder Erfüllungsgehilfen haften in keinem Fall für eine der folgenden\n   Arten von Verlust oder Schäden, die aus oder im Zusammenhang mit diesen\n   Nutzungsbedingungen entstehen (sei es in Form vertraglicher oder\n   [fahrlässiger] deliktischer Haftung):\n      - Entgangenen Gewinn, Ausfall von Umsatz und Einkünften, entgangene\n      Geschäftsgelegenheiten, Verlust des Geschäfts- oder Firmenwerts, oder\n      erwarteter Ersparnisse.\n      - Verlust oder Beschädigung von Daten.\n      - Mittelbaren Verlust oder Folgeschaden.\n   2. Unsere Haftung in Fällen von Arglist, Vorsatz und grober\n   Fahrlässigkeit sowie für die Verletzung von Leib, Leben oder Gesundheit\n   wird hierdurch nicht eingeschränkt. Das Gleiche gilt für jede vorsätzliche\n   oder fahrlässige Verletzung wesentlicher Vertragspflichten. Wesentliche\n   Vertragspflichten sind unsere Pflichten, deren Erfüllung die ordnungsgemäße\n   Durchführung der Zahlungsdienste überhaupt erst ermöglicht und auf deren\n   Einhaltung Sie als Kunde regelmäßig vertrauen dürfen, also z.B. die\n   vertragsgemäße und pünktliche Erfüllung der von Ihnen gegebenen\n   Zahlungsaufträge, jedoch nicht Auskünfte, Ratschläge oder Informationen, zu\n   denen wir rechtlich nicht verpflichtet sind und die nicht in unmittelbarem\n   Zusammenhang mit Ihrer Transaktion oder Ihrem Konto stehen.\n\n*14.5 Gewährleistungsausschluss und Einschränkungen der Verfügbarkeit\nunserer Dienste.* Ihnen stehen die gesetzlichen Rechte im Hinblick auf\nunsere Dienstleistung zu. Darüber hinaus schließen wir jedoch jegliche\nausdrückliche oder konkludente Gewährleistung oder Zusicherung aus.\n\nWir haben keinen Einfluss auf die Produkte oder Dienstleistungen, die mit\nPayPal bezahlt werden. Außerdem steht PayPal nicht dafür ein, dass ein\nKäufer oder Verkäufer, mit dem Sie Geschäfte tätigen, einen\nGeschäftsvorgang auch tatsächlich abschließt oder dazu berechtigt ist.\n\nWeiterhin können wir nicht unter allen Umständen einen ununterbrochenen,\nfortlaufenden und sicheren Zugang zu unseren Diensten gewähren.\nInsbesondere kann es aufgrund von höherer Gewalt, Aufruhr, Streik, Kriegs-\nund Naturereignissen oder durch sonstige von uns nicht zu vertretende\nVorkommnisse (zum Beispiel hoheitliche Maßnahmen im In- oder Ausland, oder\nZuverlässigkeit und Verfügbarkeit von Datenverbindungen) zu Ausfällen und\nFehlern kommen.\n\nSie nehmen hiermit außerdem zur Kenntnis, dass Ihr Zugriff auf die\nWebsite(s) gelegentlich beschränkt sein kann, um Reparaturen,\nWartungsarbeiten oder die Einführung neuer Funktionen oder Leistungen zu\nermöglichen.\n\nWir unternehmen alle zumutbaren Anstrengungen, um sicherzustellen, dass\nZahlungsaufträge zum Aufladen Ihres PayPal-Kontos und zur Abbuchung auf Ihr\nBankkonto bzw. Ihre Kreditkarte zügig bearbeitet werden.\n\nSie müssen sämtliche Korrespondenz zwischen uns sorgfältig prüfen und uns\nso bald wie möglich mitteilen, falls nach Ihrer Auffassung ein Fehler\naufgetreten ist oder die Angaben nicht Ihren Anweisungen entsprechen.\n\nSie sind selbst dafür verantwortlich, die auf Sie in Ihrer Rechtsordnung im\nZusammenhang mit Ihrer Nutzung des PayPal-Service anwendbaren Gesetze und\nsonstigen rechtlichen Bestimmungen zu verstehen und zu befolgen,\neinschließlich aller Export- und Importaktivitäten, Steuern und\nFremdwährungstransaktionen.\n\n*14.7 Freistellung.* Sie stimmen hiermit zu, PayPal sowie die mit uns\nverbundenen Unternehmen und unsere Mitarbeiter von sämtlichen Ansprüchen\n(einschließlich Anwalts- und Gerichtskosten) freizustellen, die einem\nDritten aufgrund einer Verletzung dieser Nutzungsbedingungen, aufgrund\neiner Rechtsverletzung, oder aufgrund der Nutzung unserer Dienstleistung\ndurch Sie, Ihre Mitarbeiter oder Vertreter entstanden sind bzw. von dem\nbetreffenden Dritten geltend gemacht werden.\n\n*14.8 Salvatorische Klausel und Rechte Dritter.* Diese Nutzungsbedingungen\n(einschließlich Anhängen) stellen die vollständige Vereinbarung zwischen\nIhnen und PayPal dar. Die Ziffern 1, 7, 8, 10, 14 und 15 sowie Anhang 1\n(Gebührenaufstellung) und alle weiteren Bestimmungen, die Ihrem Inhalt nach\nfortbestehen, gelten über die Kündigung oder Beendigung der vorliegenden\nVereinbarung hinaus. Sofern eine Bestimmung dieser Nutzungsbedingungen\nunwirksam ist, bleiben die übrigen Bestimmungen davon unberührt.\n\nEine Person, die nicht Partei der vorliegenden Vereinbarung ist (mit\nAusnahme von eBay in Hinblick auf die eBay in dieser Vereinbarung gewährten\nRechte), erwirbt keinerlei Rechte gemäß dem Contracts (Rights of Third\nParties) Act von 1999, auf die sie sich berufen kann oder aufgrund derer\nsie eine Bestimmung der vorliegenden Vereinbarung durchsetzen kann. Ein\nRecht oder Rechtsmittel eines Dritten, das nicht auf Grundlage des oben\nzitierten Gesetzes besteht, bleibt hiervon unberührt.\n\n*14.9 Gewährung von Lizenzen.* Für den Fall, dass Sie PayPal Software wie\netwa die API, das Developer Toolkit oder andere Softwareanwendungen, die\nSie auf Ihren Computer, auf Ihr elektronisches Gerät oder auf eine sonstige\nPlattform heruntergeladen haben, benutzen, gewähren PayPal und die\nLizenzgeber Ihnen eine beschränkte, nicht ausschließliche Lizenz zur\npersönlichen Nutzung der PayPal-Software (einschließlich sämtlicher\nAktualisierungen, Upgrades, neuer Versionen und Ersatz-Software) gemäß der\nDokumentation. Sie dürfen diese Nutzungsrechte an Dritte weder vermieten,\nverleihen, oder in anderer Weise zur Verfügung stellen.\n\nSie müssen die in der PayPal-Dokumentation enthaltenen Nutzungs- und\nIntegrationsanforderungen einhalten, ebenso wie Anweisungen, die Sie\nhinsichtlich unserer Dienstleistungen von uns erhalten. Dies gilt zum\nBeispiel auch für Nutzungs- oder Integrationsanforderungen, die aufgrund\nrechtlicher Bestimmungen oder der Regeln der Kreditkartengesellschaften\nbestehen.\n\nWenn Sie sich nicht daran halten, haften Sie für Schäden, die daraus für\nSie, PayPal oder Dritte entstehen. Sie stimmen zu, den Quellcode der\nSoftware nicht zu verändern, nachzubauen, anzupassen, weiterzugeben, zu\nveröffentlichen, rückzubauen, übersetzen, auseinanderzunehmen, zu\ndekompilieren, oder auf andere Art und Weise zu versuchen, neuen Quellcode\nzu erstellen, der auf der PayPal-Software basiert. Sie nehmen zur Kenntnis,\ndass sämtliche Rechte an der Software sowie das Eigentum PayPal zustehen.\nSoftwareanwendungen Dritter, die Sie auf der PayPal-Webseite benutzen,\nunterliegen der jeweiligen Lizenzvereinbarung, die Sie mit dem Dritten\ngeschlossen haben, der Ihnen die Software zur Verfügung gestellt hat.\nPayPal ist nicht Inhaber der Rechte an den Softwareanwendungen Dritter, die\nSie auf der PayPal-Webseite und/oder im Zusammenhang mit unseren\nDienstleistungen nutzen und übernimmt keine Verantwortung oder Haftung\nhierfür. Wenn Sie PayPal-Dienstleistungen auf der PayPal-Webseite oder\neiner anderen von PayPal oder einem Dritten betriebenen Webseite oder\nPlattform nutzen und weder Software von PayPal herunterladen noch\nSoftwareanwendungen Dritter auf der PayPal-Website benutzen, findet dieser\nAbschnitt auf die Nutzung der PayPal-Dienstleistungen durch Sie keine\nAnwendung.\n\n*14.10 Ermächtigung Dritter. *Sie können Dritte ausdrücklich ermächtigen,\nin Ihrem Namen bestimmte Handlungen vorzunehmen, sowie eine solche\nErmächtigung wiederrufen oder bearbeiten, indem Sie sich in Ihr Konto\neinloggen und auf der \"Mein Konto\"-Seite unter der Rubrik\n\"Kontoinformationen\" den Button \"API-Zugriff\" wählen. Sie stimmen zu, dass\nPayPal in diesem Fall dem Dritten verschiedene Informationen über Ihr\nPayPal-Konto bekanntgeben darf. Die Ermächtigung eines Dritten befreit Sie\nnicht von Ihren Verpflichtungen nach diesen Nutzungsbedingungen. Sie\nerkennen an und stimmen zu, dass Sie gegenüber PayPal keine Ansprüche\nerheben und PayPal von jeglicher Haftung freistellen werden, die auf einer\nHandlung oder einer Unterlassung des Dritten im Zusammenhang mit der\ngewährten Ermächtigung beruht.\n\n*14.11 Ausnahmen für Kunden, die keine Verbraucher sind.* Wenn Sie kein\nVerbraucher, Kleinstunternehmen oder eine Stiftung sind, gelten bestimmte\nRegelungen der Zahlungsdiensterichtlinie nicht für Sie. Daher gelten einige\nZiffern dieser Vereinbarung für Sie in abgewandelter Form:\n\n   1. Sie haben keinen Erstattungsanspruch gemäß Ziffer 3.10 und 12.5;\n   2. Sollten Sie einen Bearbeitungsfehler, eine unberechtigte Zahlung\n   und/oder die unberechtigte Nutzung Ihres Zahlungsinstruments gemäß Ziffer\n   12.1 und 12.2 bemerken, müssen Sie uns innerhalb von 60 Tagen nach dem\n   Bearbeitungsfehler oder dem unberechtigten Zugriff auf ein PayPal-Konto\n   benachrichtigen, anderenfalls entfällt unsere Prüfungspflicht;\n   3. Wir haften für eine unberechtigte Zahlung gemäß Ziffer 12.4 nur, wenn\n   Sie uns innerhalb von 60 Tagen den Bearbeitungsfehler oder den\n   unberechtigten Zugriff auf das PayPal-Konto angezeigt haben;\n   4. Wenn wir Ihnen gemäß Ziffer 1.5 Mitteilungen machen, so gelten sie in\n   den folgenden Fristen nach der Mitteilung als zugegangen: Bei E-Mails,\n   Veröffentlichungen auf der Webseite oder in Ihrem Konto innerhalb von 24\n   Stunden, und bei Postversand innerhalb von drei Werktagen; und\n   5. Sie können eine Beschwerde beim Ombudsmann für Finanzfragen (UK) nur\n   dann einreichen, wenn sie die entsprechenden Voraussetzungen dafür erfüllen.\n\nPayPal kann Ihnen gegenüber die in Titel 5 der \"Payment Services\nRegulations 2009\" genannten Informationspflichten erfüllen, ist dazu aber\nnicht verpflichtet. Die Artikel 60, 75, 76 und 77 der Payment Services\nRegulations finden auf Sie keine Anwendung.\n\n*15.

Eine „*geschäftliche\nZahlung*\" ist eine Zahlung, die im Zusammenhang mit dem Kauf oder Verkauf\nvon Waren oder Dienstleistungen geleistet wird. Dies umfasst auch\nZahlungen, die Sie über die Funktion „Geld anfordern\" in Ihrem PayPal-Konto\nerhalten. Eine Zahlung über „*PayPal Business Payments*\" ist eine Zahlung\nzwischen Nutzern unter Zuhilfenahme von Produkten oder Dienstleistungen von\nDrittanbietern, bei denen der Zahlungssender als Zahlungsquelle\nausschließlich ein auf dem PayPal-Konto befindliches Guthaben verwenden\nkann und für die Gebühr für „Business Payments\" anfällt. Eine „*persönliche\nZahlung*\" ist eine Zahlung, der kein Kauf oder Verkauf zugrunde liegt\n(d.h., die Zahlung wird nicht für Waren oder Dienstleistungen geleistet),\nsondern die beispielsweise an Freunde oder Familienmitglieder (unter\nVerwendung der Schaltfläche „Persönlich\" in der Funktion „Geld senden\" im\nPayPal-Konto) gesendet wird oder die Sie von Freunden oder\nFamilienmitgliedern erhalten. Sofern Sie Waren oder Dienstleistungen\nverkaufen, dürfen Sie Ihren Käufer nicht bitten, Ihnen eine persönliche\nZahlung zu senden. Sollten Sie dies dennoch tun, so kann PayPal Sie für den\nEmpfang von persönlichen Zahlungen ganz oder teilweise sperren. Bei\npersönlichen Zahlungen kann der Absender entscheiden, ob er die anfallenden\nGebühren selbst zahlt, oder der Empfänger. In den meisten Fällen\nentscheidet der Sender, die Gebühren zu tragen.

Dezember 2012\n\n* 1. Allgemeines.*\n\nVorbehaltlich Ziffer 2 und 3 dieser Richtlinie schützt PayPal den Empfänger\neiner vom Kunden veranlassten Zahlung (\"Zahlungsempfänger\") vor folgenden\nArten von Zahlungsausfällen (im Folgenden insgesamt: Verkäuferschutz):\n\n*1.1* Rückbuchungen von Zahlungen per Bankkonto; hierunter fallen unter\nanderem sämtliche Risiken des Lastschriftverfahrens (Kontounterdeckung,\nKontomissbrauch, Rücklastschriften)\n\n*1.2 *Rückbuchungen von Zahlungen per Kreditkarte\n\n*1.3 *Rückbuchungen aufgrund von ungerechtfertigten Anträgen im Rahmen des\nPayPal-Käuferschutzes oder des PayPal-Standard-Käuferbeschwerdeverfahrens\n\n*1.4 *Rückbuchungen von Zahlungen, die durch den Inhaber des PayPal-Kontos\nnicht genehmigt wurden\n\nDer Verkäuferschutz gilt nur, wenn die Rücklastschrift oder\nKreditkartenrückbuchung aus folgenden Gründen erfolgt:\n\n   - Die Zahlung wurde nicht durch den Inhaber genehmigt. oder\n   - die Rücklastschrift, Kreditkartenrückbuchung, oder der\n   Käuferschutzantrag beruht darauf, dass der Käufer den Artikel nicht\n   erhalten hat.\n\nund PayPal von Ihnen einen Nachweis erhält, dass der Artikel im Einklang\nmit den unter nachstehender Ziffer 4 genannten Voraussetzungen versendet\nwurde. Ferner müssen die weiteren in dieser\nPayPal-Verkäuferschutzrichtlinie genannten Voraussetzungen (einschließlich\nder unter Ziffer 3 genannten Bedingungen) erfüllt sein.\n\nDer Verkäuferschutz gilt nicht, wenn Grund für die Rückbuchung war, dass\nder Artikel erheblich von der Beschreibung abweicht.\n\nPayPal schränkt den Zugriff des Zahlungsempfängers auf den Zahlungsbetrag\nein, sobald ein Käufer eine Kreditkartenrückbuchung bzw. Rücklastschrift\nveranlasst, oder einen Antrag auf Käuferschutz stellt bzw. eine\nKäuferbeschwerde einreicht, oder wenn ein unberechtigter Kontozugriff\nvorliegt. In diesem Fall hat der Verkäufer keinen Zugriff auf den\nentsprechenden Zahlungsbetrag.\nDies kann zwischenzeitlich zu einem negativen PayPal-Kontostand des\nZahlungsempfängers führen.\n\nPayPal hebt den vorübergehenden Einbehalt auf, wenn die Voraussetzungen für\nden Verkäuferschutz erfüllt sind.\n\n*2. Umfang.*\n\nBei dem gekauften Artikel handelt es sich um einen gegenständlichen,\nmateriellen Artikel, der versendet werden kann.\n\nDarüber hinaus sind folgende Artikel nicht abgedeckt:\n\n   - Immaterielle Güter, Dienstleistungen, Geschenkgutscheine, Flugtickets,\n   Downloads, Softwarelizenzen und weitere nicht physische Güter\n   - Fahrzeuge mit einem Motor, beispielsweise Autos, Motorräder, Boote und\n   Flugzeuge\n   - Artikel, die nicht versendet werden können\n   - Artikel bei Selbstabholung durch den Käufer\n\nBei Zahlungen über \"PayPal Business Payments\" und Transaktionen, die über\nZong abgewickelt werden, findet der Verkäuferschutz keine Anwendung. Der\nVerkäuferschutz findet außerdem keine Anwendung für Auszahlungen auf eBay\nüber PayPal, da im Zusammenhang mit solchen Auszahlungen auf eBay keine\nKäuferschutzansprüche gegen das PayPal-Konto durchgesetzt werden, es sei\ndenn der Verkäufer stimmt im Einzelfall explizit einer Rückzahlung zu. Dies\nberührt nicht das Recht von PayPal, evtl. nach einer Zahlung vorhandenes\nGuthaben auf Ihrem PayPal-Konto zum Ausgleich eines negativen Kontostandes\nzu verwenden (hierzu siehe Ziffer 5.2 der Nutzungsbedingungen).\n\nZahlungen für alle anderen Artikel sind vom Verkäuferschutz umfasst.\n\n*3. Voraussetzungen.*\n\nPayPal schützt den Zahlungsempfänger, wenn die folgenden Voraussetzungen\nerfüllt sind.\n\n*3.1* Der Status eines Zahlungseingangs wurde dem Zahlungsempfänger von\nPayPal als \"abgeschlossen\" angezeigt.\n\n*3.2* Der Zahlungsempfänger beantwortet sämtliche Anfragen von PayPal\nbezüglich des vorübergehend einbehaltenen Zahlungsbetrags innerhalb der von\nPayPal vorgegebenen Frist; in der Regel bedeutet dies innerhalb von sieben\nbis zehn Tagen. Antworten sind in der Regel online auf der Webseite von\nPayPal oder per E-Mail zu geben.\n\nDies umfasst auch Anfragen zur Dokumentation oder Verifizierung der\nordnungsgemäßen Auslieferung der Ware, die von PayPal in angemessenem\nUmfang zur Untersuchung des Geschäftsvorgangs gefordert werden können.\n\n*3.3* Der Zahlungsempfänger hat die Zahlung als eine Zahlung von einem\nregistrierten PayPal-Konto erhalten [keine Teilzahlung, keine Anzahlung,\nkeine Hinterlegung, keine Ratenzahlung].\n\n*3.4* Der der Zahlung zugrunde liegende Artikel verstößt nicht gegen die\nPayPal-Nutzungsrichtlinie<https://email-edg.paypal.com/r/1O0QKGJ/D4ZK9T/IO6VRR/RNOTIQ/JIQWDI/7M/h>.\n\n\n*3.5* Der Verkäufer hat den Artikel versandt und PayPal wird der\nVersandbeleg gemäß Ziffer 4 vorgelegt.\n\n   - Falls der Zahlungsempfänger dem Käufer den Zahlungsbetrag bereits\n   erstattet hat, kann er alternativ zu einem Versandbeleg auch einen Beleg\n   der erfolgten Erstattung vorlegen.\n\n*3.6* Der Verkäufer hat den Artikel an die auf der Seite\n\"Transaktionsdetails\" angegebene Adresse versandt. Wenn der Artikel vom\nKäufer persönlich abgeholt wird oder der Verkäufer den Artikel persönlich\nausliefert oder an eine andere als auf der Seite \"Transaktionsdetails\"\nangegebene Adresse versendet, gilt der Verkäuferschutz nicht.\n\n*3.7* Um Verkäuferschutz in dem Fall zu erhalten, dass der Käufer den\nArtikel nicht erhalten hat, muss der Verkäufer den Artikel innerhalb von\nsieben Kalendertagen nach Zahlungseingang versandt haben. Dies gilt nicht\nfür vorbestellte oder noch herzustellende Artikel; diese müssen innerhalb\nder vom Verkäufer in seinem Angebot angegebenen Frist versandt werden.\n\n*4. Versandbeleg.*\n\n*4.1 Allgemein.* Der Zahlungsempfänger belegt innerhalb der von PayPal\nhierfür gesetzten Frist (in der Regel 7-10 Tage) den Versand eines Artikels\ndurch Vorlage einer Online-Nachverfolgungsnummer oder eines Versandbelegs\neines unabhängigen Versandunternehmens (Versandbelege), die im PayPal-Konto\nhochgeladen werden können. Wenn PayPal anhand der\nOnline-Nachverfolgungsnummer den Versand gemäß den Bestimmungen dieser\nRichtlinie nicht nachvollziehen kann, weil die Angaben zum Versand nicht\nmehr online abrufbar sind, so reicht die Vorlage einer\nOnline-Nachverfolgungsnummer nicht als Versandbeleg aus.\n\n*4.2 Gültiger Versandbeleg.* PayPal akzeptiert einen Versandbeleg, wenn auf\ndiesem die folgenden Angaben enthalten sind:\n\n*4.2.1 *Name des Versandunternehmens\n\n*4.2.2* Versanddatum\n\n*4.2.3 *Name und Adresse des Empfängers.\n\nDiese Angaben müssen mit Name und Adresse auf der Seite\n\"Transaktionsdetails\" übereinstimmen.\n\n*4.2.4 *Name und Adresse des Versenders.\n\nDiese Angaben müssen mit Name und Adresse des Verkäufers übereinstimmen.\n\n\n\nNachfolgend eine nicht abschließende Liste von Versandunternehmen, deren\nVersandbelege die zuvor genannten Voraussetzungen in der Regel erfüllen.\nDer Zahlungsempfänger muss sich jedoch im Einzelfall versichern, dass die\nVersandbelege die oben genannten Voraussetzungen erfüllen.\n\n   - Deutsche Post AG / DHL (bitte beachten Sie, dass nicht alle Produkte\n   die Anforderungen der Ziffer 4.2 erfüllen. Beispielsweise erfüllen Päckchen\n   ohne Nachweis und Briefe, einschl. Warensendung, Buchsendung und Maxibrief\n   die Anforderungen nicht)\n   - GLS\n   - DPD\n   - Hermes\n   - UPS\n   - FedEx\n   - TNT\n\nZusätzlich wird auch der Versandbeleg eines Einschreibens der Deutschen\nPost AG als Versandbeleg akzeptiert, wenn die folgenden Angaben auf dem\nVersandbeleg enthalten sind:\n\n   - Einlieferungsdatum\n   - Name des Empfängers\n\n   Der Name des Empfängers muss mit dem auf der Seite \"Transaktionsdetails\"\n   angezeigten Namen übereinstimmen.\n\n*5. Schlussbestimmungen.*\n\n*5.1 *PayPal behält sich vor, Informationen und Belege anzufordern und\ngegebenenfalls den Zugriff des Zahlungsempfängers auf sein PayPal-Konto\neinzuschränken, falls PayPal den begründeten Verdacht hat, dass dieser\nZahlungsempfänger in betrügerischer Absicht handelt. PayPal behält sich\ndarüber hinaus vor, in diesen Fällen keinen Schutz zu gewähren.\n\n*5.2* PayPal behält sich vor, Rückbuchungen von Zahlungen per Kreditkarte\noder Bankkonto, inklusive der durch Kreditkartenfirmen oder Banken in\nRechnung gestellten Gebühren, an den Zahlungsempfänger weiterzureichen,\nfalls die Voraussetzungen gemäß Ziffer 3 nicht erfüllt sind.\n\n*5.3* PayPal behält sich vor, den Zahlungsbetrag, der einem Antrag des\nKäufers im Rahmen des PayPal-Käuferschutzes auf eBay oder des\nPayPal-Käuferbeschwerdeverfahrens bei sonstigen Online-Käufen zugrunde\nliegt, vom Zahlungsempfänger einzuziehen, falls die Voraussetzungen gemäß\nZiffer 3 nicht erfüllt sind.\n\n*5.4* PayPal behält sich vor, jederzeit im eigenen Ermessen und ohne Angabe\nvon Gründen diesen Schutz zu ändern oder zu beenden. Offene Forderungen zum\nZeitpunkt der Streichung werden weiterbearbeitet, bis eine endgültige\nEntscheidung vorliegt.\n\n*5.5 *Es wird PayPal gestattet, auf Versandinformationen des jeweiligen\nVersandunternehmens zuzugreifen, um den Versand eines Artikels zu\nüberprüfen. Soweit erforderlich trägt der Zahlungsempfänger dafür Sorge,\ndass PayPal Zugriff auf diese Informationen gestattet wird.\n\n*PayPal-Käuferschutzrichtlinie*\n\nZuletzt aktualisiert am 19. Dezember 2012\n\n*1. Allgemeines*.\n\nDer PayPal-Käuferschutz schützt den Käufer, falls ein gekaufter Artikel\nnicht versandt wurde oder der gelieferte Artikel erheblich von der\nArtikelbeschreibung des Verkäufers abweicht, siehe hierzu Ziffer 4.\n\nDer PayPal-Käuferschutz gilt nur für materielle Artikel, die versandt\nwerden können, siehe hierzu Ziffer 3.2 und 2.3.\n\nSobald der Käufer einen Antrag auf PayPal-Käuferschutz gestellt hat, wird\nPayPal den Antrag prüfen und gegebenenfalls weitere Informationen von\nKäufer und Zahlungsempfänger anfordern, um eine Klärung herbeizuführen.\n\nAlternativ kann der Antrag im eBay-Konfliktlösungscenter gestellt werden.\n\n*2. Auszahlung.*\n\nWenn ein Antrag auf PayPal-Käuferschutz erfolgreich ist, erstattet PayPal\ndem Käufer den Kaufpreis inkl. Versandkosten. Wenn die Zahlung in einer\nanderen Währung als Euro erfolgt, erfolgt auch die Auszahlung in dieser\nWährung.\n\nDie Auszahlung erfolgt unabhängig davon, ob PayPal den Erstattungsbetrag\nvon dem Zahlungsempfänger zurückfordern kann.\n\n*3. Anspruchsberechtigung. *\n\nUm den PayPal-Käuferschutz in Anspruch nehmen zu können, müssen die\nfolgenden Bedingungen erfüllt sein.\n\n*3.1* Der Käufer hat einen Artikel gekauft und mit PayPal bezahlt.\n\n*3.2 *Bei dem gekauften Artikel handelt es sich um einen gegenständlichen,\nmateriellen Artikel, der versandt werden kann.\n\n*3.3 *Die folgenden Artikel sind *nicht* durch den PayPal-Käuferschutz\nabgesichert:\n\n   - Immaterielle Güter, Dienstleistungen, Cash-Transaktionen (nur USA),\n   Geschenkgutscheine, Flugtickets, Softwarelizenzen, Downloads und weitere\n   nicht physische Güter sowie Sonderanfertigungen\n   - Fahrzeuge mit einem Motor, beispielsweise Autos, Motorräder, Boote und\n   Flugzeuge\n   - Artikel, die nicht versandt werden\n   - Industrielle Maschinen, die in der verarbeitenden Industrie verwendet\n   werden\n\n*3.4* Die PayPal-Zahlung steht in Zusammenhang mit dem gekauften Artikel.\nDas bedeutet, dass die Zahlung\n\n   - über die Funktion \"Jetzt zahlen\" auf der eBay-Website oder\n   - über die Funktion \"Geld senden\" und unter Angabe der\n   eBay-Artikelnummer im PayPal-Konto oder\n   - bei Käufen außerhalb eBays: über die Funktion \"Geld senden\" auf der\n   PayPal Webseite durch Anklicken der \"Kaufen\"-Schaltfläche oder im Rahmen\n   des PayPal-Checkout-Ablaufs.\n\nAndere Zahlungen, die Sie außerhalb dieser Funktionen tätigen, können wir\nnicht zuordnen und sind daher nicht vom Käuferschutz abgedeckt.\n\nSie müssen die Kaufpreiszahlung als eine einzige Zahlung von einem\nregistrierten PayPal Konto aus gemacht haben (keine Teilzahlungen, keine\nRatenzahlungen, keine Anzahlungen, keine Hinterlegungen).\n\n*3.5* Der Artikel verstößt nicht gegen die\nPayPal-Nutzungsrichtlinie<https://email-edg.paypal.com/r/1O0QKGJ/D4ZK9T/IO6VRR/RNOTIQ/S3USFP/7M/h>\n.\n\n*3.6* Der Käufer meldet innerhalb von 45 Tagen, nachdem die Zahlung auf der\nPayPal-Website eingeleitet wurde, den Konflikt und versucht, diesen unter\nVerwendung der hierfür durch PayPal bereitgestellten Hilfsmittel zu klären.\nDies ist nach dem Einloggen in das PayPal-Konto unter \"Konfliktlösungen\"\nmöglich. Falls eine Klärung hierdurch nicht erreicht wird, stellt der\nKäufer innerhalb von 20 Tagen nach Einleitung der Konfliktlösung einen\nAntrag auf PayPal-Käuferschutz. Dies ist ebenfalls nach dem Einloggen in\ndas PayPal-Konto unter Konfliktlösungen möglich.\n*3.7* Des Weiteren erfüllt der Käufer die in Ziffer 5 beschriebenen\nBedingungen.\n\n*4. Welche Fälle sind abgesichert? *\n\nDer Käufer hat PayPal-Käuferschutz in den folgenden Fällen:\n\n*4.1 Der bezahlte Artikel wurde bei einem vereinbarten Versand durch den\nVerkäufer nicht versandt oder nachfolgend in dieser Ziffer 4.1 beschriebene\nsonstige Verpflichtungen des Verkäufers werden nicht eingehalten. *\n\nDer PayPal-Käuferschutz wegen *nicht* versandter Artikel gilt nicht für\nArtikel, die während des Versands verloren gehen. Falls der Verkäufer in\nder geschuldeten Frist einen gültigen Versandbeleg (wie im Detail in der\nVerkäuferschutzrichtlinie beschrieben) oder ein entsprechendes zwischen\nVerkäufer und PayPal vereinbartes Äquivalent vorlegt, welches Versand bzw.\nEmpfang nachweist, so lehnt PayPal den Antrag auf PayPal-Käuferschutz ab.\n\nVor einem Antrag auf PayPal-Käuferschutz muss der Käufer dem Verkäufer\neinen ausreichend langen Zeitraum für den Versand und die Lieferung\neingeräumt haben, mindestens eine Woche, und zunächst versuchen, den\nKonflikt durch direkte Kontaktaufnahme mit dem Verkäufer zu klären.\n\n*4.2 Der gelieferte Artikel weicht erheblich von der Artikelbeschreibung\ndes Verkäufers ab.*\nNachfolgend mehrere Beispiele, in denen ein Artikel erheblich von der\nArtikelbeschreibung abweicht.\nDie folgende Aufzählung ist nicht abschließend.\n\n   - Der Artikel ist ein völlig anderer, als der in der Artikelbeschreibung\n   beschriebene, zum Beispiel ein Hörbuch anstelle einer Druckversion, ein\n   Desktop-PC anstelle eines Laptops, eine leere Schachtel.\n   - Der Zustand des gelieferten Artikels weicht erheblich von dem\n   beschriebenen Zustand ab, zum Beispiel ist der Artikel offensichtlich\n   mehrfach benutzt worden anstelle von neu und originalverpackt.\n   - Der Artikel kann nicht verwendet werden, dies war jedoch nicht in der\n   Artikelbeschreibung beschrieben worden, bspw. fehlen wichtige Komponenten\n   oder Teile, der Artikel funktioniert nicht oder das Haltbarkeitsdatum ist\n   überschritten. Hinweis: Dies gilt für den Zustand des Artikels, in dem der\n   Käufer ihn erhalten hat, unabhängig davon, in welchem Zustand er versandt\n   worden ist.\n   - Der Artikel ist nicht authentisch, dies war jedoch nicht in der\n   Artikelbeschreibung beschrieben worden, bspw. ein gefälschter Artikel oder\n   eine Raubkopie.\n   - Es fehlt ein Teil der bestellten Menge, beispielsweise wurden zehn\n   Golfbälle bezahlt, jedoch nur vier geliefert.\n\nNachfolgend werden mehrere Beispiele genannt, in denen ein Artikel\n*nicht*erheblich von der Artikelbeschreibung abweicht. Die folgende\nAufzählung ist\nnicht abschließend.\n\n   - Der Artikel funktioniert nicht richtig, in der Artikelbeschreibung war\n   jedoch bspw. Folgendes angegeben: \"Artikel funktioniert möglicherweise\n   nicht richtig\", \"Es fehlen Teile\", \"Das Foto zeigt Kratzer oder\n   Beschädigungen\".\n   - Der Käufer möchte den Artikel nicht mehr, nachdem er ihn erhalten hat,\n   oder der Artikel entspricht nicht den Erwartungen des Käufers. Der Artikel\n   war aber in der Artikelbeschreibung richtig beschrieben.\n   - Die Artikelbeschreibung ist für beide Seiten missverständlich.\n   Beispielsweise hat der Artikel scheinbar eine andere Farbe als angeboten;\n   er ist in den Augen des Käufers hellgrün, der Verkäufer definiert die Farbe\n   in der Produktbeschreibung aber als türkis.\n\nPayPal entscheidet von Fall zu Fall anhand entsprechend einzureichender\nNachweise, ob der Artikel tatsächlich entsprechend von der\nArtikelbeschreibung abweicht.\n\nDie Entscheidung über den Antrag auf PayPal-Käuferschutz ist endgültig. Der\nRechtsweg gegenüber PayPal wegen dieser Entscheidung ist ausgeschlossen.\n\n*4.3* Der Käufer kann pro PayPal-Zahlung nur einen Antrag auf\nPayPal-Käuferschutz stellen, entweder weil der Verkäufer den Artikel nicht\nversandt hat oder weil der Artikel erheblich von der Artikelbeschreibung\nabweicht. Allerdings können Sie den Grund Ihres Antrags nachträglich über\nunser Online Konfliktlösungscenter oder indem Sie unseren Kundenservice\nkontaktieren, ändern (z.B. haben Sie zunächst einen Artikel nicht erhalten,\ndann erfolgt die Lieferung eines Artikels, der erheblich von der\nBeschreibung abweicht).\n\n*4.4* Ein Antrag auf PayPal-Käuferschutz kann für mehrere Artikel gelten,\nbeispielsweise wenn der Käufer drei Artikel kauft, von denen zwei nicht\nversandt werden. Der Käufer muss den Antrag für beide Artikel gemeinsam als\neinen Antrag stellen.\n\n*5. Pflichten des Käufers. *\n\n*5.1* Der Käufer muss sämtliche Anfragen von PayPal bezüglich des Antrags\nauf PayPal-Käuferschutz innerhalb von zehn Tagen beantworten. PayPal wird\nden Antrag ablehnen, falls eine Beantwortung innerhalb der genannten Frist\nnicht erfolgt. PayPal kann diese Frist verlängern, wenn außergewöhnliche\nUmstände vorliegen, die nicht der Kontrolle des Käufers unterliegen.\n\n*5.2* Wenn der Käufer einen Antrag auf PayPal-Käuferschutz stellt, weil der\nerhaltene Artikel erheblich von der Artikelbeschreibung des Verkäufers\nabweicht, muss der Käufer den Artikel auf Verlangen von PayPal auf Kosten\ndes Käufers an den Verkäufer zurücksenden und einen entsprechenden\nZustellbeleg vorlegen. PayPal wird die Rücksendung nicht verlangen, wenn\nein begründeter Verdacht besteht, dass die Rücksendung eine\nRechtsverletzung zur Folge haben würde. PayPal behält sich außerdem vor,\nweitere Dokumente zur Unterstützung der Forderung von dem Käufer\nanzufordern. Der Käufer hat die ihm hierfür eventuell entstehenden Kosten\nzu tragen.\n\n*6. Schlussbestimmungen.*\n\n*6.1 Abtretung des Rückzahlungsanspruches.* Der Käufer tritt mit dem\nEmpfang der Auszahlung des PayPal-Käuferschutzes alle gegenüber dem\nVerkäufer bestehenden Ansprüche aus dem Antrag auf PayPal-Käuferschutz\nzugrunde liegenden Kaufvertrag in Höhe des Auszahlungsbetrages an PayPal\nab. Es wird klargestellt, dass PayPal im Falle einer vollständigen\nBefriedigung aus solchen abgetretenen Rechten den Verkäufer aufgrund der\nNutzungsbedingungen wegen des gleichen Sachverhalts nicht doppelt in\nAnspruch nehmen wird.\n\n*6.2 Verfügbarkeit des PayPal-Käuferschutzes.* PayPal behält sich das Recht\nvor, jederzeit im eigenen Ermessen und ohne Angabe von Gründen den\nPayPal-Käuferschutz zu ändern oder zu streichen. Offene Forderungen zum\nZeitpunkt der Streichung werden weiterbearbeitet, bis eine endgültige\nEntscheidung vorliegt.\n\n*6.3 Zugriff auf Versandinformationen.* Der Käufer erlaubt PayPal, in\nseinem Namen auf Versandinformationen des jeweiligen Versandunternehmens\nzuzugreifen, um den Versand eines Artikels zu überprüfen.\n\n*6.4 Käuferschutz durch PayPal oder eBay. *PayPal lehnt einen Antrag auf\nPayPal-Käuferschutz ab, falls der Käufer bereits eine Auszahlung im Rahmen\neines etwaigen Käuferschutzprogrammes von eBay erhalten hat.\n\n*6.5 Gesetzliche Rechte.* Die PayPal-Käuferschutzrichtlinie berührt die\ngesetzlichen Rechte des Käufers nicht. PayPal tritt nicht als Vertreter von\nKäufer, Verkäufer oder Zahlungsempfänger auf. PayPal entscheidet lediglich\nüber den Antrag auf PayPal-Käuferschutz.\n\n*6.6 PayPal-Käuferschutz und Rückbuchungsrecht gegenüber dem\nKreditkartenanbieter. *Der Käufer kann entweder einen Antrag auf\nPayPal-Käuferschutz oder einen Antrag auf Rückbuchung einer\nKreditkartenzahlung gegenüber dem Kreditkartenanbieter stellen. Eine\nzweifache Auszahlung ist nicht möglich. PayPal lehnt einen Antrag auf\nPayPal-Käuferschutz ab, wenn eine Rückbuchung einer Kreditkartenzahlung\neingeleitet wird. Dies gilt unabhängig von dem Ausgang des Antrags auf\nRückbuchung einer Kreditkartenzahlung gegenüber dem Kreditkartenanbieter.\nDas Zurückziehen oder das Ablehnen eines Antrags auf PayPal-Käuferschutz\nhat keine Auswirkungen auf den Antrag auf Rückbuchung einer\nKreditkartenzahlung gegenüber dem Kreditkartenanbieter. Es gelten die\nBestimmungen des jeweiligen Kreditkartenanbieters. Es wird grundsätzlich\nempfohlen, bei Konflikten, die nicht direkt mit dem Verkäufer geklärt\nwerden können, einen Antrag auf PayPal-Käuferschutz zu stellen. PayPal\nbehält sich das Recht vor, den Zugang des Käufers zu dessen PayPal-Konto\neinzuschränken oder das PayPal-Konto zu schließen, wenn das Recht auf\nRückbuchung gegenüber dem Kreditkartenanbieter missbraucht wird. Darüber\nhinaus behält sich PayPal das Recht vor, unrechtmäßige Rückbuchungen\nentsprechend anzufechten. Dies geschieht in Übereinstimmung mit den Regeln\ndes jeweiligen Kreditkartenanbieters.\n            *Fragen zu PayPal?*\nKontakt: *www.PayPal.de/kontakt* <http://www.PayPal.de/kontakt>\nWeitere Informationen:\nwww.PayPal.de<https://email-edg.paypal.com/r/1O0QKGJ/D4ZK9T/IO6VRR/RNOTIQ/YHGPLG/7M/h>|\nPasswort\nvergessen?<https://email-edg.paypal.com/r/1O0QKGJ/D4ZK9T/IO6VRR/RNOTIQ/KE9XYS/7M/h>|\nSicherheit<https://email-edg.paypal.com/r/1O0QKGJ/D4ZK9T/IO6VRR/RNOTIQ/WLHNUG/7M/h>|\nHilfe-Center<https://email-edg.paypal.com/r/1O0QKGJ/D4ZK9T/IO6VRR/RNOTIQ/40VB6Z/7M/h>\n    Copyright\n© 1999–2012 PayPal.

Then, the reviewer can for instance already check against similar existing points, and we can build this out to create a review tool that makes it very easy to review a\nnew service, or update the review of an existing service. But first we want to start with this very simple \"submit a data point\" form. So what we need for that is:\n\n* an html form. It should fit in the current Bootstrap layout, and be usable on both desktop and smartphones. Fields, probably:\n   - service (can be a free text input, if there is a typo in the service name, the curator can align it with https://github.com/tosdr/tosdr.org/tree/master/services)\n   - topic (same, see https://github.com/tosdr/tosdr.org/tree/master/topics, free text is ok for the first version)\n   - short description (to appear in the points list on the main page and as the subject of the email)\n   - short description (to appear inside the popup and as the body of the email)\n   - good/info/bad (multiple choice field)\n   - importance (a number from 0 to 100, aka 'weight')\n   - a 'sign in with Persona' button\n   - a 'submit' button\n* a server-side form-processing script that:\n   - checks the Persona assertion\n   - saves a JSON file into a designated directory on the server's file system\n   - sends an email out to the mailing list (you probably want to use something like sendgrid for this)\n\nAs the existing ToS;DR team members are all busy already with other task, we are looking for someone to join the team, to take on this noble task\nof developing our \"review tools\". Who wants to do this? We are all in this as volunteers, so this is not a job that will get you rich, or even pay you a reasonable web developer rate. But nonetheless you'll get a symbolic 10 euros from the donations money as a compensation for each hour you put in as part of the team.\n\nThere is no specific place or time you have to be, this project lives in cyberspace. :) There is also no specific requirement on which programming\nlanguage to use, although if you stick with a mainstream server-side languages (that basically means nodejs, ruby or php), it will be easier for most other people to contribute to it.\n\nIf you know a web developer who has worked with Mozilla Persona and/or scripts that save files and send emails before, and you think they may be interested in working more closely with our project, then also please alert them to this request.\n\nIf you're willing to help us out with this, then please come to #tosdr on freenode (our IRC chat channel).\n\n\nCheers!\nMichiel\n\n-- \ntosdr.org | twitter.com/tosdr | github.com/tosdr\n--- You received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups \"Terms of Service; Didn't Read\" group.\nTo unsubscribe from this group and stop receiving emails from it, send an email to tosdr+unsubscribe@googlegroups.com.\nTo post to this group, send email to tosdr@googlegroups.com.\nVisit this group at http://groups.google.com/group/tosdr?hl=en.\nFor more options, visit https://groups.google.com/groups/opt_out.\n\n\n"},

This \n> Section 26.1 applies to any dispute EXCEPT THAT IT DOES NOT INCLUDE A \n> DISPUTE RELATING TO THE ENFORCEMENT OR VALIDITY OF YOUR, MICROSOFT’S, OR \n> EITHER OF OUR LICENSOR’S INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. “Dispute” means \n> any dispute, action, or other controversy between you and Microsoft \n> concerning the Microsoft Store, the Services, this Contract, or any product \n> or service offered, whether in contract, warranty, tort, statute, \n> regulation, ordinance, or any other legal or equitable basis. \"Dispute\" \n> will be given the broadest possible meaning allowable under law.\n>\n>    1. Notice of Dispute. In the event of a dispute, you or Microsoft must \n>    give the other a Notice of Dispute, which is a written statement that sets \n>    forth the name, address and contact information of the party giving it, the \n>    facts giving rise to the dispute, and the relief requested. You must send \n>    any Notice of Dispute by U.S. Mail to Microsoft Corporation, ATTN: LCA \n>    ARBITRATION, One Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052-6399. A form is \n>    available at go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=245499. Microsoft will \n>    send any Notice of Dispute to you by U.S. Mail to your address if we have \n>    it, or otherwise to your e-mail address. You and Microsoft will attempt to \n>    resolve any dispute through informal negotiation within 60 days from the \n>    date the Notice of Dispute is sent. After 60 days, you or Microsoft may \n>    commence arbitration. \n>    2. Small Claims Court. You may also litigate any dispute in small \n>    claims court in your county of residence or King County, Washington, if the \n>    dispute meets all requirements to be heard in the small claims court. You \n>    may litigate in small claims court whether or not you negotiated informally \n>    first. \n>    3. Binding Arbitration. IF YOU AND MICROSOFT DO NOT RESOLVE ANY \n>    DISPUTE BY INFORMAL NEGOTIATION OR IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT, ANY OTHER EFFORT \n>    TO RESOLVE THE DISPUTE WILL BE CONDUCTED EXCLUSIVELY BY BINDING \n>    ARBITRATION. You are giving up the right to litigate (or participate in as \n>    a party or class member) all disputes in court before a judge or jury. \n>    Instead, all disputes will be resolved before a neutral arbitrator, whose \n>    decision will be final except for a limited right of appeal under the \n>    Federal Arbitration Act. Any court with jurisdiction over the parties may \n>    enforce the arbitrator’s award. \n>    4. Class Action Waiver. ANY PROCEEDINGS TO RESOLVE OR LITIGATE ANY \n>    DISPUTE IN ANY FORUM WILL BE CONDUCTED SOLELY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS. \n>    NEITHER YOU NOR MICROSOFT WILL SEEK TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE HEARD AS A CLASS \n>    ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, OR IN ANY OTHER PROCEEDING IN \n>    WHICH EITHER PARTY ACTS OR PROPOSES TO ACT IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY. NO \n>    ARBITRATION OR PROCEEDING WILL BE COMBINED WITH ANOTHER WITHOUT THE PRIOR \n>    WRITTEN CONSENT OF ALL PARTIES TO ALL AFFECTED ARBITRATIONS OR PROCEEDINGS. \n>    5. Arbitration Procedure, Costs and Fees. Any arbitration will be \n>    conducted by the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA”) under its \n>    Commercial Arbitration Rules and in many cases its Supplementary Procedures \n>    for Consumer-Related Disputes. For more information, see www.adr.orgor call 1-800-778-7879. In a dispute involving $75,000 or less, Microsoft \n>    will promptly reimburse your filing fees and pay the AAA’s and arbitrator’s \n>    fees. You and Microsoft agree to the terms governing procedures, fees, and \n>    incentives at http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=279535. To \n>    commence arbitration, submit the form available at \n>    go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=245497 to the AAA. You agree to \n>    commence arbitration only in your county of residence or in King County, \n>    Washington. Microsoft agrees to commence arbitration only in your county of \n>    residence. \n>    6. Claims or Disputes Must Be Filed Within One Year. To the extent \n>    permitted by law, any claim or dispute relating to the Microsoft Store, the \n>    Services, this Contract, or any product or service offered must be filed \n>    within one year in small claims court (Section 26.1.2), an arbitration \n>    proceeding (Section 26.1.3), or in court, if Section 26.1 permits the \n>    dispute to be filed in court instead of arbitration. The one-year period \n>    begins when the claim or Notice of Dispute first could be filed. If a claim \n>    or dispute is not filed within one year, it is permanently barred. \n>    7. Rejecting Future Arbitration Changes. You may reject any change \n>    Microsoft makes to Section 26.1 (other than address changes) by sending us \n>    notice within 30 days of the change by U.S. Mail to the address in Section \n>    26.1.1. If you do, the most recent version of Section 26.1 before the \n>    change you rejected will apply. \n>    8. Severability. If the class action waiver in Section 26.1.4 is found \n>    to be illegal or unenforceable as to all or some parts of a dispute, then \n>    Section 26.1 will not apply to those parts. Instead, those parts will be \n>    severed and proceed in a court of law, with the remaining parts proceeding \n>    in arbitration. If any other provision of Section 26.1 is found to be \n>    illegal or unenforceable, that provision will be severed with the remainder \n>    of Section 26.1 remaining in full force and effect. \n>\n>  \n>\n> From <\n> http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msca/en_CA/DisplayTermsOfUseAndSalePage/ThemeID.27659600/\n> > \n>\n\n-- \ntosdr.org | twitter.com/tosdr | github.com/tosdr\n--- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups \"Terms of Service; Didn't Read\" group.\nTo unsubscribe from this group and stop receiving emails from it, send an email to tosdr+unsubscribe@googlegroups.com.\nTo post to this group, send email to tosdr@googlegroups.com.\nVisit this group at http://groups.google.com/group/tosdr?hl=en.\nFor more options, visit https://groups.google.com/groups/opt_out.\n\n\n"},

In the event that\nany amount on a third party site does not match the same amount on\nwww.centuryLink.com or your printed bill, the www.centuryLink.com and the\npaper bill amount (the two being the same) will be deemed to be the\naccurate amount. In the event the paper bill and the amount listed on your\nonline bill at www.centuryLink.com do not agree, the paper bill should be\nconsidered the correct bill and should be used to determine the amount to\nbe paid. You may elect to have Company retain your payment information,\nincluding but not limited to your billing name, address, telephone number,\ncredit card/debit card/account numbers, expiration dates, for you\nconvenience and use in future transactions authorized by you. You are\nresponsible for adding, updating, maintaining, deleting and verifying the\naccuracy of any payment information that you ask Company to store for you.\nYou agree that Company will not be responsible for any transactions\nrejected due to erroneous or outdated payment information. You also agree\nthat Company will not be liable for any use, misuse, lost, stolen or\nincorrect payment information.\n6. Bill Messages. Company may include messages developed by Company or as\nrequired by state and federal authorities in the body of the bill. It is\nyour responsibility to view the entire bill.\n7. Options to Receive Your Bill. Company may offer the option to receive\nyour bill either via US postal service or via email. If you elect the\noption to receive your bill via email, you authorize Company to stop\nsending you paper bills via mail and understand that you may receive one\nmore paper bill depending on your billing cycle. Please note that you will\nhave the option to print a paper copy on your home computer or save it to a\nfile. Each month, you will receive an email notification when your new bill\nis available and understand that if, for any reason, you are unable to view\nyour bill online, you are still required to make your payment on time.\nAlso, under these circumstances, you are responsible for obtaining a bill\ncopy and/or account balance by calling the Company customer service at\n1-877-290-5458. You also agree to provide Company with your email address\nfor the receipt of eBill notices and agree to keep your email address\nupdated and understand that it is your responsibility to log in and view\nyour bill each month, even if you do not receive an eBill notice for any\nreason. Company will notify you via postal mail that your address needs to\nbe updated if it receives a message that your email bill notification is\nundeliverable. However, if your email bill notification is undeliverable\nfor three consecutive months, then Company will re-activate your paper\nbill. You understand that any late payment notices will still be sent\nthrough the U.S. postal mail and you agree to pay your bill using one of\nthese approved methods (since sending paper checks without the remittance\nstub may delay payment posting): Automatic Payments, Company online\npayments or online payments from your financial institution or bill payment\nservice provider.\n8. Fees. There are no additional fees charged by Company for using the\nServices. But if you pay your bill electronically through a financial\ninstitution, you are responsible for any charges you may incur from the\nfinancial institution in order to make online payments.\n9.

Company is not liable to you for any failure or\ninability to obtain necessary encryption software.\n10. Password.

You understand that you have sole\nresponsibility for the security of your password. You are solely\nresponsible for notifying us of the loss or theft of a password.

I am a \ndesigner and a Ph.D student researching in the area of user privacy issues \nin digital services and embedded sensing technologies.\n\nSince my research interests covers ToS and Privacy policies I would like to \nuse the ToS;DN platform as a tool to understand privacy issues related to \nthe usage of some 'smart devices' such as the ones listed here \n<http://enchantedobjects.com/wp-content/uploads/EnchantedObjectsPoster.png>.\n\nMy first experiment is with Mimo's Privacy policy \n<http://mimobaby.com/legal/#PrivacyPolicy>. In order to better understand \nPrivacy Policy (PP) I will forward my rating proposals using the new \nToS;DN's platform form (when I will be able to use it \n<https://groups.google.com/d/msg/tosdr/t4Rb8pX88rU/1Q5uOFmDbYoJ>). In \naddition, I have an open question regarding a particular aspect of the PP, \nfor those in the community interested to answer.\n\n\nI apologize for the length of my email.\n\nIn order to ease the reading I have put some descriptors. \n\n*The final questions are at the end* (/// questions).\n\nThanks in advance to everyone that will take this into consideration and \ngive their opinion.\n\n\n\n/// What is Mimo\n\nMimo is a cloud base baby monitor that, using the company's words: “[helps \nparents to] get real-time audio and insights about [their] baby’s sleep \nactivity, right on [the] smart device, from anywhere in the world”.\n\n/// brief introduction to Mimo's Privacy Policy\n\nIt seems that Rest Device Inc., who is the organization owning Mimo, \ncollects 3 principal kind of user information: (1) *personal information*, \n(2) *aggregated information* and (3) *profile*, which is a combination of \nboth the information gathered from users and acquired from third parties. \nEven though privacy policy (PP) related to Personal Information are clear \nand well explained, PP for ‘Profile’ looks to be more ambiguous.\n\n(1) *Personal Information* \"means information that specifically identifies \nan individual (such as a name, address, telephone number, mobile number or \ne-mail address) or other information about that individual that is directly \nlinked to Personal Information. Except for some 'features that give [users] \nthe option to share certain of your information with friends and other \nthird parties, [the service] do not share Personal Information with third \nparties. Moreover, Personal Information does not include \"aggregate\" \ninformation’.\n\n\n(2) *Aggregated information* are not linked to Personal Information but can \nbe shared with affiliates organizations and business associates e.g. \n'aggregated demographic information about our user'.\n\nThe situation is more complicated for the *Profile* (3). As claimed by the \ncompany: It is made ' by storing 'information that we collect through \ncookies, log files, clear gifs, and/or third party sources to create a \n\"profile\" of your preferences'. Moreover, Profile information is shared \nwith third parties in aggregated form only.\n\nAgain, at least for the moment Mimo 'does not tie users Personal \nInformation, or purchasing history, to information in the profile, in order \nto provide tailored promotions' etc. that it should means that Profile and \nPersonal Information are kept separately.\n\n/// the controversial part\n\nThe more controversial part came at this point: 'To *enrich our profiles* \nof individual customers, we tie [information purchased *from third parties*] \nto the *Personal Information* [that users/individual customers] have \nprovided to us. For me, such sentence sounds like a negation of what has \nbeen claimed above, when the company told that Profile and Personal \nInformation are not tied together, and now they are.\n\n/// questions\n\n*[1] If that is true it means that Profile is a combination of Personal \nInformation and aggregated data that was not supposed to be linked together \n(?).*\n\n*[2] Finally, even though Profile is shared with third parties in \naggregated form only, does it mean that Rest Device Inc. does not share \nusers personal data* with third parties?*\n\nI am sorry if I made some ingenuity during my explanation and/or if my \nsummary of the Mimo's privacy policy is not so clearly explained.\n\n\n*with ‘Personal Data’ I am taking into consideration the definitions in \nArticle 2 of EU Directive 95/46/EC: Any information relating to an \nidentified or identifiable natural person (“data subject”); an identifiable \nperson is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular \nby reference to an identification number or to one or more factors specific \nto his physical, physiological, mental, economic, cultural or social \nidentity.\n\n-- \ntosdr.org | twitter.com/tosdr | github.com/tosdr\n--- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups \"Terms of Service; Didn't Read\" group.\nTo unsubscribe from this group and stop receiving emails from it, send an email to tosdr+unsubscribe@googlegroups.com.\nTo post to this group, send email to tosdr@googlegroups.com.\nVisit this group at http://groups.google.com/group/tosdr.\nFor more options, visit https://groups.google.com/d/optout.\n"},

But it is possible that I overestimated some of these\nclauses so far… Are they really needed?\n\nLet's have an hypothetical case, where someone uploads a remix on\nsoundcloud. That remix contains a sample of a song by Frank Zappa. Then,\nGail Zappa of the \"Zappa Family Trust\" hears about the song, gets upset\nand sends a DMCA-style notice to Soundcloud.\n\nFirst thing: it's not obvious that the remix is copyright infringement.\nLet's say the sample is very brief and does not seem to qualify for\n\"originality.\"\n\nSecond thing: what will Soundcloud do? At this time, it's in their hands\nto be prompt at removing alleged infringing material. If they fail to\ncomply with the law (DMCA, or ecommerce or whatever similar law applies\nin our case) why should I indemnify them? All I did is upload a remix\nwhich I thought, in good faith, was totally ok under copyright law.\n\nThird thing: if it is my content, then I can still be sued by Zappa, or\nSoundcloud (for breaching their terms). I would prefer to have\neverything dealt with by a judge under copyright/contract law, than to\nhave everything handled from a contractual obligation raised from a\nlawsuit between Soundcloud and some copyright holder.\n\nIn the end, not having these broad indemnification clauses does not seem\nto close any opportunity for soundcloud to get back at their users if\nsomething goes wrong. So they don't seem necessary for me, although they\ndo create some non-negligible risks.\n\nWhat do others think?\n-- \nHugo Roy \n  French Coordinator, FSFE       chat: hugo@jabber.fsfe.org\n  www.fsfe.org/about/roy         mobile: +336 08 74 13 41\n                                 mobile DE: +49 151 143 56 563\n\n-- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups Terms of Service; Didn't Read group.

Here's a quickie on Meetup.com, a site for facilitating real-world gatherings of people with common interests (\"using the Internet to get off the Internet\").\n\nTOPIC: Notice of Changing Terms\n\nThe top of Meetup's TOS isn't great, but it's a fairly typical we-may-change-at-any-time-check-our-website statement.  There's no notification; it is the user's responsibility to look at the most recent revision \"frequently.\" \n\nWhat I was surprised by is down below in Fees & Payments.  They reserve the right to start charging for use of the website at any time.  They also reserve the right to change features/services and their fees at any time.  And, once they notify you (not specified how), you must pay and Meetup doesn't care about your expenses, overdrawn accounts, etc.  They don't specify what would happen to your account info if you choose not to pay.  They don't specify how they will notify you - just one email that might end up in a spam or Gmail Promotions folder?  The only saving grace here is that free users of Meetup don't provide payment info (at least, not as of last year, when I signed up for my account).  So I guess this mean-sounding policy doesn't have teeth vis-a-vis free users.  Which means it doesn't play out practically in addition to sounding unfriendly. \n\n\nHere's the text (at http://www.meetup.com/terms/)\n\n3. Fees and Payments\n3.1 General. Access to our websites and use of selected features of our Platform is free. We may charge fees for various premium features and services that we offer, and we will notify you of those charges at the time that we offer you the premium features or services for a fee. We may, in our sole discretion, and by notifying you on our website, change this policy and begin charging for access to our website and other features and services, and we may, in our sole discretion, add, remove or change the features and services we offer or the fees (including the amount or the type of fees) we charge at any time. If we introduce a new service or charge a new fee, we will establish and notify you of the fees for that service at the launch of the service or start of charging a new fee. If we notify you of new fees or change the fees for an existing service, you agree to pay all fees and charges specified and all applicable taxes for your continued use of the applicable service. We are not responsible for any charges or expenses you incur resulting from being billed by us in accordance with these Terms of Service (e.g., overdrawn accounts, exceeding account limits, etc.). \n\n\n-- \ntosdr.org | twitter.com/tosdr | github.com/tosdr\n--- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups \"Terms of Service; Didn't Read\" group.\nTo unsubscribe from this group and stop receiving emails from it, send an email to tosdr+unsubscribe@googlegroups.com.\nTo post to this group, send email to tosdr@googlegroups.com.\nVisit this group at http://groups.google.com/group/tosdr.\nFor more options, visit https://groups.google.com/groups/opt_out.\n"},

YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO OPT OUT OF THE BINDING\n    ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER PROVISIONS AS DESCRIBED IN\n    SECTION 17. \n\nSection 17:\n\n    17. BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION\n\n    Purpose. The term \"Dispute\" means any dispute, claim, or\n    controversy between you and any Sony Entity regarding any SEN\n    First Party Services or the use of any devices sold by a Sony\n    Entity to access SEN First Party Services, whether based in\n    contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, tort (including, but\n    not limited to, fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent\n    inducement, or negligence), or any other legal or equitable\n    theory, and includes the validity, enforceability or scope of\n    this Section 17 (with the exception of the enforceability of\n    the Class Action Waiver clause below). \"Dispute\" is to be\n    given the broadest possible meaning that will be enforced. If\n    you have a Dispute with any Sony Entity or any of a Sony\n    Entity's officers, directors, employees and agents that cannot\n    be resolved through negotiation within the time frame\n    described in the \"Notice of Dispute\" clause below. Other than\n    those matters listed in the Exclusions from Arbitration\n    clause, you and the Sony Entity that you have a Dispute with\n    agree to seek resolution of the Dispute only through\n    arbitration of that Dispute in accordance with the terms of\n    this Section 17, and not litigate any Dispute in court.\n    Arbitration means that the Dispute will be resolved by a\n    neutral arbitrator instead of in a court by a judge or jury.\n\n    Exclusions from Arbitration. YOU AND THE SONY ENTITIES AGREE\n    THAT ANY CLAIM FILED BY YOU OR BY A SONY ENTITY IN SMALL\n    CLAIMS COURT ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THE ARBITRATION TERMS\n    CONTAINED IN THIS SECTION 17.\n\n    RIGHT TO OPT OUT OF BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION\n    WAIVER WITHIN 30 DAYS. IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO BE BOUND BY THE\n    BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER IN THIS SECTION\n    17, YOU MUST NOTIFY SNEI IN WRITING WITHIN 30 DAYS OF THE DATE\n    THAT YOU ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT UNLESS A LONGER PERIOD IS\n    REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW. YOUR WRITTEN NOTIFICATION MUST BE\n    MAILED TO 6080 CENTER DRIVE, 10TH FLOOR, LOS ANGELES, CA\n    90045, ATTN: LEGAL DEPARTMENT/ARBITRATION AND MUST INCLUDE:\n    (1) YOUR NAME, (2) YOUR ADDRESS, (3) YOUR SEN FIRST PARTY\n    SERVICES ONLINE ID, IF YOU HAVE ONE, AND (4) A CLEAR STATEMENT\n    THAT YOU DO NOT WISH TO RESOLVE DISPUTES WITH ANY SONY ENTITY\n    THROUGH ARBITRATION.\n\n    Notice of Dispute.

You agree\n    to negotiate resolution of the Dispute in good faith for no\n    less than 60 days after you provide notice of the Dispute. If\n    the Sony Entity you have a Dispute with does not resolve your\n    Dispute within 60 days from receipt of notice of the Dispute,\n    you or the Sony Entity you have a Dispute with may pursue your\n    claim in arbitration pursuant to the terms in this Section 17.\n\n    Class Action Waiver. ANY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEEDINGS,\n    WHETHER IN ARBITRATION OR COURT, WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN\n    INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION\n    OR AS A NAMED OR UNNAMED MEMBER IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED,\n    REPRESENTATIVE OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, UNLESS BOTH\n    YOU AND THE SONY ENTITY WITH WHICH YOU HAVE A DISPUTE\n    SPECIFICALLY AGREE TO DO SO IN WRITING FOLLOWING INITIATION OF\n    THE ARBITRATION. THIS PROVISION DOES NOT PRECLUDE YOUR\n    PARTICIPATION AS A MEMBER IN A CLASS ACTION FILED ON OR BEFORE\n    AUGUST 20, 2011. THIS PROVISION IS NOT APPLICABLE TO THE\n    EXTENT SUCH WAIVER IS PROHIBITED BY LAW.\n\n    Initiation of Arbitration Proceeding/Selection of Arbitrator.\n    If you or the Sony Entity you have a Dispute with elect to\n    resolve your Dispute through arbitration, the party initiating\n    the arbitration proceeding may initiate it with the American\n    Arbitration Association (\"AAA\"), www.adr.org, or JAMS\n    www.jamsadr.com. The terms of this Section 17 govern in the\n    event they conflict with the rules of the arbitration\n    organization selected by the parties.\n\n    Arbitration Procedures. Because the software and/or service\n    provided to you by the Sony Entity you have a Dispute with\n    concern interstate commerce, the Federal Arbitration Act\n    (\"FAA\") governs the arbitrability of all Disputes. However,\n    applicable federal or state law may also apply to the\n    substance of any Disputes. For claims of less than $75,000,\n    the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related\n    Disputes (\"Supplementary Procedures\") shall apply including\n    the schedule of arbitration fees set forth in Section C-8 of\n    the Supplementary Procedures; for claims over $75,000, the\n    AAA's Commercial Arbitration Rules and relevant fee schedules\n    for non-class action proceedings shall apply. The AAA rules\n    are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879.\n    Further, if your claims do not exceed $75,000 and you provided\n    notice to and negotiated in good faith with the Sony Entity\n    you had a Dispute with as described above, if the arbitrator\n    finds that you are the prevailing party in the arbitration,\n    you will be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys' fees and\n    costs as determined by the arbitrator, in addition to any\n    rights to recover the same under controlling state or federal\n    law afforded to the Sony Entity you have a Dispute with or\n    you. The arbitrator will make any award in writing but need\n    not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a\n    party. Such award will be binding and final, excerpt for any\n    right of appeal provided by the FAA, and may be entered in any\n    court having jurisdiction over the parties for purposes of\n    enforcement.\n\n    Location of Arbitration. You or the Sony Entity you have a\n    Dispute with may initiate arbitration in either San Mateo\n    County, California or the United States county in which you\n    reside. In the event that you select the county of your United\n    States residence, the Sony Entity you have a Dispute with may\n    transfer the arbitration to San Mateo, County in the event\n    that it agrees to pay any additional fees or costs you incur\n    as a result of the change in location as determined by the\n    arbitrator.\n\n    Severability. If any clause within this Section 17 (other than\n    the Class Action Waiver clause above) is found to be illegal\n    or unenforceable, that clause will be severed from this\n    Section 17, and the remainder of this Section 17 will be given\n    full force and effect. If the Class Action Waiver clause is\n    found to be illegal or unenforceable, this entire Section 17\n    will be unenforceable, and the Dispute will be decided by a\n    court and you and the Sony Entity you have a dispute with each\n    agree to waive in that instance, to the fullest extent allowed\n    by law, any trial by jury.\n\n    Continuation. This Section 17 shall survive any termination of\n    this Agreement or the provision of SEN First Party Services to\n    you.\n\n-- \nHugo Roy, Project Lead\nTerms of Service; Didn't Read | www.tosdr.org\n\n-- \ntosdr.org | twitter.com/tosdr | github.com/tosdr\n--- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups \"Terms of Service; Didn't Read\" group.\nTo unsubscribe from this group and stop receiving emails from it, send an email to tosdr+unsubscribe@googlegroups.com.\nTo post to this group, send email to tosdr@googlegroups.com.\nVisit this group at http://groups.google.com/group/tosdr?hl=en.\nFor more options, visit https://groups.google.com/groups/opt_out.\n\n\n"},

They will delete that copy and anyone else who legally \nhas a copy of it. This is just wrong as if I own it, I shouldn't be \npunished because someone else had the same file and shared it illegally.\n\nAnother point I read was they do not allow reverse engineering of their \ncode. This isn't good for security reasons. If I cannot reverse engineer \nwithout my account being deleted, I cannot assess if it's secure or not and \nprovided holes to the company at the email address they provided to send \nsecurity problems found.

Unlike\ntheir \"Like\" button and social applets, developers using Facebook's Open\nGraph API can also track users directly through Facebook.\n\nI need to investigate a bit more, but here's an article from TechChrunch\nhttp://techcrunch.com/2012/06/26/facebooks-hidden-like-isnt-just-good-for-mobile-developers-its-good-for-facebook/\n\nOnce you skip all the buzzwords and the future anticipation platitude,\nthere are interesting facts.\n\n        But the Facebook “like,” still relatively new in the grand\n        scheme of things, has already become synonymous with “market to\n        me in my News Feed.” The decision to press the seemingly\n        innocuous thumbs up now holds a meaning that even less technical\n        folks have come to understand. It’s the modern equivalent of\n        “add my name to your email distribution list.” (So far we’ve\n        come, so little has changed.)\n        \n        That’s why the “hidden” like is so interesting. It’s integrated\n        seamlessly into the application. You’re not “liking” a Facebook\n        Page, you’re “liking” an Instagram photo. And it’s not a thumbs\n        up icon – it’s a little heart…or whatever else the developer\n        sees fit to use. The point being: it looks like part of the app\n        itself. It will become impossible to tell (without reading all\n        the pop-up disclaimers and EULAs – and who does?) which in-app\n        actions will live within the app and which populate Facebook.\n        And that’s the idea. That’s how they getcha.\n        \n        …\n        \n        In a (not-so-distant?) future, you can see where this is headed,\n        in terms of advertising. A user “likes” Instagram photos of\n        beaches and sunsets. The user then sees ads for vacations and\n        cruises on Facebook. A user “likes” a friend’s Starbucks\n        check-in in Foursquare, but has never “liked” Starbucks’ fan\n        page on Facebook. Now Starbucks knows to show them ads and\n        deals. It’s the re-creation of the tracking cookie’s\n        capabilities in a “web” where people surf mobile applications,\n        not websites. And what could it become? The possibilities are\n        mind-boggling. You “like” photos of beaches, you launch a travel\n        app to book plane tickets for a work trip and find Caribbean\n        vacation packages are now on sale. Coincidence, or “like”\n        tracking? You may not know, but what’s even better, is that you\n        may not care.\n        \nI assume these things will start to popup in mobile apps terms, as well\nas web apps.

Bing uses this information only to operate and \nimprove the services we provide to you, and not for any other purposes such \nas advertising.\n\nFacebook currently powers the enhanced people search feature, so if you \nsubmit a search query while signed into Facebook that Bing classifies as a \nperson’s name, we send the query to Facebook, which Facebook uses to return \nthe relevant results.\n\nFacebook does not use this query information for any other purpose, and \ndeletes it within 24 hours.\n\nYou can turn off these Instant Personalization features at any time. The \nfirst five times you do a Bing search that will show social results, you \nwill see a notification at the top of your screen; clicking “disable” will \ndisable the features and prevent Bing from using your Facebook information \nto personalize your experience.

(for instance,\nwordpress.com also offering wordpress.org is one of the main reasons\nwhy i would talk positively about wordpress.com, and advise friends to\nuse it)\n- do they care about the security your data with things like https\n- do they answer to questions\n- are their terms easy to read\n- do they change the terms often\n- are they engaged in standing up against unreasonable laws\n- do they (in practice) try to notify you if a government requests\naccess to your private data or downtake of your publications\n- do they send you third party cookies\n- or (worse) third party javascript\n- is their service accessible for minorities (who may use a screen\nreader or who maybe speak Swahili rather than English)\n\nI think these points should have a smaller impact than the things you\nare actually made to accept legally. We should also only review these\npoints if we have objectively quantifiable data, never based on one\nsingle occurrence for instance. We should only focus on online user\nrights, so topics like privacy, freedom of speech, freedom to use and\nchoose technology. Not topics like pricing, usability, features,\netcetera.\n\nAnd i think we should clearly mark these additional data points as\nsuch, so that it's obvious to the user whether or not something is\npart of the contract or not.\n\nWhen we just got started, we had only one such type of data point (the\none about federated free software), and made it a search filter\ninstead of a data point. But now i already listed 10, so having 10\nfilter checkboxes is no longer feasible. Also not mentioning good\npoints or bad points about a service that do affect our rights a\nonline users, would give an incomplete view. So i propose to display\nthem in a separate list, as 'additional data points'.\n\nFor instance, if you look at twitter, there are 10 data points, of\nwhich probably about half are 'additional' in the sense that you\ncannot point at a specific paragraph in any of their legally binding\nterms or policy texts.\n\nCurious what other people think about this.\n\n\nCheers!\nMichiel\n"},

These rules were created to help limit\nthe flaming and common disagreements that can occur on public forums.\nThey are also a way to ensure that we do not offend other users.\n\nGeneral Rules:\n\n1. Attacks - As with any large groups of people there will be\ndisagreements. This is understandable, but we will not tolerate flaming\nother members. We are all adults and in such should be able to keep our\nemotions in check. There will not be any personal/insulting attacks or\ninflammatory posts. You can disagree, but do it politely.\n\n2. Language - No dirty language. We are trying to create a place where\nyou don’t have to worry if your child is sitting next to you while\nreading. Please keep your language clean. The friendly workarounds on\nusing crude language will not be tolerated also. We are not talking\nabout damn, hell, and other small ones, we are talking about the major\nones and you know what they are.\n\n3. Opposite Sex - We are starting to pick up more female users. These\nfemales offer an insight that we “males” cannot offer, so make sure to\nkeep derogatory comments about the opposite sex in check. If you are not\nwilling to say it face to face, don’t think it is ok from behind the\nkeyboard.\n\n4. Post Count - You want to up your membership status, please help us\nout by saying hello to new members. No multiple or repeat postings to\nget your post count up.\n\n5. Advertising – There are many users that want to advertise their\nproducts or products of others. If you are not a contributing member to\nthe forum these advertisements will not be tolerated. For those who are\npromoting products please ensure they are related to the 2nd Amendment.\n\n6. Accounts – You are only allowed one account. If your account is\nsuspended or deleted you are not allowed to create another account. If\nmultiple accounts are discovered they will be deleted!\n\n7. Content – This site is for the carrying of firearms for personal\nprotection and the protection of the 2nd Amendment. There are many\nissues out there that can get out of hand real quick. Keep this in mind\nwhen opening a thread that does not contain pertinent info to the site’s\npurpose. We will keep a close eye on threads that run the risk of\ngetting out of hand quickly and will close it down if it starts going\nbad. Do not create a thread or post about anything illegal such as\ncarrying concealed illegally. Your thread/post will be deleted and you\nwill be warned.\n\n8. Photos - Members are allowed and encouraged to post on topic\npictures. Please keep your picture appropriate and clean. Photos that\nare considered inappropriate will be removed and you will be notified of\nsuch. If this problem continues you will risk having your account\nsuspended or deleted. This includes your avatar.\n\nThese are some of the basic rules to govern the forums. We cannot think\nof everything so we reserve the right to create new rules or contact you\non a case by case base. Remember keep it civil and be nice. If things\nare getting out of hand we will have to jump in and give warnings, close\nthreads, or suspend/delete accounts.\n\nMarketplace Rules:erm\n\n-- \n[!!] Please see https://edit.tosdr.org -- this is where new contributions should be submitted and discussed\n\ntosdr.org | twitter.com/tosdr | github.com/tosdr\n--- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups \"Terms of Service; Didn't Read\" group.\nTo unsubscribe from this group and stop receiving emails from it, send an email to tosdr+unsubscribe@googlegroups.com.\nTo post to this group, send email to tosdr@googlegroups.com.\nVisit this group at https://groups.google.com/group/tosdr.\nTo view this discussion on the web visit https://groups.google.com/d/msgid/tosdr/0508bec0-57a7-2f6a-0cef-5cc2493e5169%40gmail.com.\nFor more options, visit https://groups.google.com/d/optout.\n"},

Amazon does not require you to acknowledge terms when you view or visit the site.  What would make this hold up is if there was a very visible notice or a acknowledgement indicating that you agreed.  It's like asking about a raffle and then being required to enter it simply by asking about it.  It's almost a nonsensical stipulation.  This is exactly why legitimate parking lots have \"we will tow you\" signs posted at the entrance of their lots.\n\nAs you read the rest of this - remember that you have already agreed to this by virtue of visiting Amazon's website.\n       \n\"you agree to accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your account or password. Amazon does sell products for children, but it sells them to adults, who can purchase with a credit card or other permitted payment method. If you are under 18, you may use Amazon.com only with involvement of a parent or guardian.\"  This is a somewhat contradictory clause.  If your kid makes a purchase on Amazon (without your consent), he or she is entering into a contract with Amazon, which is immediately void because the contract is with a minor. Amazon is saying that you would be responsible, but that they cannot sell products to kids without their parents permission.  Clear as mud?\n\n\"We each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration we each waive any right to a jury trial.\"  That is, no one (not even a lawyer on your behalf) can bring a class action lawsuit against Amazon.

[https://www.eff.org/who-has-your-back-2013?support_whyb=1]\n\nWhen you use the Internet, companies ask you to trust them with your private data: from personal messages, to search terms, to photos, and much more. But government officials increasingly ask companies to hand that data over, a fact highlighted by the recent battle over CISPA.\n\nTo make \"Who Has Your Back?\", EFF lawyers and activists review company policies and interview legal departments to find out exactly how companies deal with government requests for your data. We review their answers and give stars to companies with industry-leading policies and practices, which helps privacy-conscious users make informed decisions and encourages the companies to step it up.\n\nBut the real power behind \"Who Has Your Back?\" comes from you. EFF's strong and principled community pushes companies to take privacy seriously, and after three years, we're proud to report that even more companies have moved towards instituting best practices when it comes to standing up for users’ privacy from the government.\n\nWe’re proud to be fighting for users’ rights, made possible by donations from individuals like you. Please consider supporting projects like \"Who Has Your Back?\" by joining EFF today! [https://supporters/eff.org/donate/who-has-your-back]\n\nThank you,\n\nMarcia Hoffman\nEFF Senior Staff Attorney\nElectronic Frontier Foundation, 815 Eddy Street, San Francisco, CA 94109 USA\n\nEFF appreciates your support and respects your privacy: https://www.eff.org/policy\n\nUnsubscribe from future mailings or change your email preferences: https://supporters.eff.org/civicrm/profile/edit?reset=1&gid=18&id=512789&cs=1262c1a34a5d0187f860116c08295849_1367352628_168\n-- \nHugo Roy\n\nsent from my mobile, with free software: www.freeyourandroid.org. please excuse my brevity.\n\nTel. +336 08 741 341\n\n-- \ntosdr.org | twitter.com/tosdr | github.com/tosdr\n--- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups \"Terms of Service; Didn't Read\" group.\nTo unsubscribe from this group and stop receiving emails from it, send an email to tosdr+unsubscribe@googlegroups.com.\nTo post to this group, send email to tosdr@googlegroups.com.\nVisit this group at http://groups.google.com/group/tosdr?hl=en.\nFor more options, visit https://groups.google.com/groups/opt_out.\n\n\n"},

It's in Spanish right now, and only a draft (currently, we're\npretty accessible and liberal^Hanarchist to deal with each case.)\n\nOur aim is to be classified A in according to your terms, so we're\nlooking for your input. Please tell me if you need translation. The\noriginal is at\nhttps://n-1.cc/pg/dokuwiki/5241/doku.php?id=propuesta_030610 and you\ncan edit the wiki directly if you're a member of the group (you can\nlogin with OpenID.)\n\nHere we go:\n\n\nLa idea es tener diferentes documentos que recojan:\n* Un texto sobre Aviso legal del servicio.\n\n* Un texto sobre privacidad derivada del uso del servicio.\n\n* Un texto sobre Filosofía/fundamentos del proyecto: qué es y qué no\nes, qué puedes o no hacer (no lo legal, sino la netiqueta), la\nindicación de la licencia de su código, el compromiso social, etcétera.\n\nEl documento deberá estar redactado en “lenguaje para humanos”. Sólo\nel “aviso legal” se atendrá a la terminología (jerga) jurídica.\n\nEstos términos deberán ser enviados cuando la gente rellene el\nformulario de registro dentro de la red y podrían empezar así:\n\n¡ A T E N C I Ó N! Deberías haber leído esto primero. Muchas veces\n“aceptamos” demasiado deprisa las condiciones o licencias que nos\nexigen algunos sitios para registrarnos y luego nos llevamos\ndecepciones cuando nos enteramos demasiado tarde de las cosas que\nhemos “aceptado”. Esperamos que estés de acuerdo con las nuestras. Si\nno, por favor, no te registres.\n\n\nEstructura\n\n  1. ¿Qué son los \"Términos y condiciones de usos\"?\n  2. Aviso legal del servicio\n  3. Privacidad derivada del uso del servicio\n  4. Filosofía del proyecto\n  4.1.  ¿Qué es y qué no es N-1?\n  4.2.  ¿Qué puedes hacer y qué no deberías hacer en N-1?\n  4.3   Compromisos de N-1 con sus habitantes\n  4.4   Licencias\n\n\n1. ¿Qué son los \"Términos y condiciones de uso\"?\n\nLos “Términos y condiciones de uso” son el documento en el que se\nexplica qué es la red social N-1 y dónde se establecen las condiciones\npara poder usarla. Incluye el aviso legal del servicio, un detalle de\nla privacidad derivada del uso del servicio, así como una descripción\nde la filosofía del proyecto, detallando que es y que no es N-1, que\ntipo de usos se pueden hacer y cuales no, qué compromisos N-1 adquiere\nexpresamente con sus habitantes, así como se provee un detalle de las\nlicencias y derechos sobre los contenidos de la red, Estas condiciones\nlegales nos obligan a todas las habitantes de N-1.\nTodo el documento, excepto el “Aviso Legal”, está redactado en\nlenguaje humano comprensible y puede incluir enlaces para facilitar su\ncomprensión y contextualización.\nEn lo sucesivo cuando decimos “habitantes” nos referimos a los y las\n“usuario/as” es decir personas que se han creado una cuenta y usan el\nsoftware de Lorea dentro de la red social N-1.\n\n2. Aviso legal del servicio\n\nhttp://derecho-internet.org/aviso (Se podría incluir el link y no el\ntexto y así cuando se actualice el contenido en el origen no cesitamos\nmodificar el nuestro …).esto sigue sin parecerme claro, nuestro amigo\nlegal nos dijo de usar las de foofind pero no se aplican strictu\nsensus asi que no sé como adaptarlas.\nLos presentes términos de uso se presentan en idioma español. En el\ncaso de que desde esta web se proporcione una traducción de estos\ntérminos de uso en cualquier otro idioma distinto al español, se\nreconoce que se realiza por razones de conveniencia y que tu relación\ncon esta red social se regirá por lo dispuesto en estos términos de\nuso en en su versión en español.\nToda integración de servicios de terceros está sujeta a las\ncondiciones que sus proveedores declaren, te invitamos a leerlas en\nsus webs para utilizarlos conscientemente. Entre estos proveedores\nestán: Identi.ca, YouTube, Vimeo, Blip.tv, Metacafe, Giss.tv y\nproveedores de identidad estandarizados como OpenID, Ostatus,\nFOAF+SSL. Esta lista no tiene porqué estar completa ya que puede ir\ncambiando al integrar nuevos servicios de terceros dentro de esta red\nsocial. Te animamos a visitar la página en la cual se publican las\nnuevas funcionalidades.\n\n3. Privacidad derivada del uso del servicio\n\nTu privacidad es nuestra preocupación principal. Nuestro objetivo es\nmantener la menor cantidad de información personal posible sin poner\nen riesgo la fiabilidad de la herramienta y prevenir el abuso de los\nrecursos de nuestros servidores. Recomendamos a las habitantes de N-1,\ny visitantes, ser imaginativas a la hora de conectarse a nuestras\npáginas y utilizar todas aquellas medidas que crean necesarias para\nmantener su privacidad intacta. (correos electrónicos seguros - no de\nproveedores comerciales - encriptación GPG - TOR etc). Recuerda: el\nGran Hermano te vigila.\nLos servidores de N-1 no están en el territorio del Estado Español ni\nen su ámbito de influencia. Los contenidos de las redes provienen de\ndiversos lugares situados dentro del cyberespacio.\nEn cualquier momento cualquier habitante podrá acceder a sus propios\ndatos personales para modificarlos (todo lo que publicas, puedes\nreeditarlo o quitarlo menos tus mensajes dentro de foros que hayan\nsido transformados en listas de correo) o borrarlos (puedes borrar\ncada contenido y en la configuración de tu perfil también aparece un\nbotón de “suicidio digital”, si lo accionas se borran todos los datos\nde tu perfil y escritorio individual. Las publicaciones que hayas\nrealizado dentro de tus grupos se quedan y deberás borrarlas\nmanualmente si no quieres dejar ningún rastro).\nMantenemos registros mínimos: en general, no mantenemos información\nque pueda identificar a una habitante de manera única o que pueda ser\nusada para construir un perfil de uso o asociaciones. Para depurar\nproblemas podríamos habilitar un registro más detallado por un corto\nperíodo de tiempo. Este registro adicional sería eliminado después de\nser usado.\nNo compartimos datos con nadie, ni tampoco venderemos nunca datos de\nnuestras habitantes a terceros. Dentro del colectivo N-1 sólo tenemos\nacceso a la información imprescindible para realizar nuestro trabajo.\nNo monitorearemos las comunicaciones: no leeremos, buscaremos o\nprocesaremos los correos entrantes o salientes, más allá de protección\ncontra correo no deseado, otras amenazas o cuando las habitantes nos\nlo pidan al depurar problemas.\nDefenderemos la información de las habitantes y nos opondremos\nactivamente a cualquier intento de forzar el colectivo N-1 a revelar\ndatos o registros.\nTanto la información que guardamos como las comunicaciones estan\ncifradas: el contenido de las comunicaciones, la fecha de último\ningreso, las libretas de direcciones y todas las copias de respaldo\nson almacenadas en un formato cifrado.\nRecordamos que la privacidad es una noción ambigua: no exijas lo\nimposible, no expongas cosas cuando tengas dudas respecto a\npublicarlas, piensa siempre en cómo lo que publicas pueda afectar la\nprivacidad de otras personas y no hagas nada que no quisieras que te\nhicieran.\n\n4. Filosofía del proyecto\n\n\n4.1.¿Qué es y qué no es N-1?\n\nN-1 es una red social libre, segura, federada y autogestionada. N-1 es\nun dispositivo tecnopolítico sin ánimo de lucro que pretende ampliar\nnuestras posibilidades de crear y difundir contenidos usando\nherramientas libres, desarrolladas y autogestionadas desde una ética\nhorizontal y antagonista para la base y desde la base.\nEs una de las redes sociales federadas de Lorea (una “semilla”), lo\nque significa que es parte de un dispositivo más amplio que permite\ncrear y administrar redes sociales relacionadas entre ellas y que los\ncompromisos técnicos que adquiere con sus habitantes no son\nrespaldados sólo para N-1, sino desde Lorea para todas sus semillas.\nN-1 es un colectivo informal de personas preocupadas por la libertad,\nla seguridad y la privacidad en internet. Trabajamos de manera\nhorizontal buscando el consenso y evitando relaciones de poder.\nEl perfil N-1Crew esta compuesto por personas que administramos y\ncuidamos la red social N-1. No nos consideramos proveedores de\nservicio y no fomentamos el asistencialismo, sí la involucración en el\ndiseño colectivo de nuestras herramientas tecnopolíticas. Por eso en\nlugar de personas “usuarias” hablamos de “habitantes”. Estos términos\nhan sido redactados colectiva y públicamente (entre mayo 2010 y mayo\n2012) y te sugerimos leer también las FAQ y los manuales y participar\nen los grupos de de ayuda, testeo y desarrollo de las redes sociales\nfederadas Lorea.\nN-1 es una herramienta de software libre, parte de código libre y\nlibera el código que desarrolla bajo licencias GPL y AGPL.\nN-1 promueve las licencias libres y el compartimiento de recursos e\ninformación útil para los colectivos activistas y de transformación\nsocial y política (encontrarás detalles más amplios en la sección 4.4.)\nN-1 es anti-sexista, anti-racista, anti-capitalista. Promueve la\nautogestión, la sostenibilidad ecológica, la auto determinación y la\nautonomía, las economías alternativas sociales y solidarias.\nPara poner a disposición estas redes sociales necesitamos recursos. Te\ninvitamos a que visites la página dónde se listan las tareas y vías de\nparticipación dentro de Lorea y N-1 colaborando en el desarrollo,\nsoporte y testeo. Te pedimos que nos ayudes a cubrir los costes de las\nredes sociales de Lorea de manera justa: aceptamos donaciones para el\nmantenimiento de los servidores, la administración y el desarrollo.\n\n4.2. ¿Qué puedes hacer y qué no deberías hacer en N-1?\n\nNo se permite el uso de N-1 para spam, ni para actividades comerciales\nbasadas en el copyright y otras licencias privativas, ni para el\ndesarrollo de propaganda política por parte de partidos políticos\nformales.\nN-1 promueve el software libre, las licencias libres y la cultura\nlibre. Por ello te pedimos en la medida de lo posible de: No subir\narchivos con formatos privativos como .doc, .ppt etc y de usar\nformatos libres como .rtf, .odt etc. Puedes encontrar en este enlace\nuna lista de alternativas libres para cada formato.\nNo se permite el uso de N-1 para fomentar contenidos sexistas,\nracistas así como de defensa del capitalismo y otras formas de\nopresión autoritaria. Somos gente de mentalidad abierta, pero eso no\nimpide que si encontramos algo ofensivo, ilegal o improcedente te\nescribiremos para hacértelo saber y te pediremos que lo borres. Si no\nlo haces, prevalecerá nuestro criterio al borrarlo y/o banearte de\nesta red social. Los criterios de ofensivo, ilegal e improcedente se\naplican también a enlaces externos que puedas publicar dentro de tus\nmensajes.\nSi te encuentras con contenidos ofensivos, ilegales e improcedentes\npuedes reportarlo escribiendo un correo al perfil N1Crew dando a\nconocer el enlace de ese contenido o denunciando contenido. N1Crew no\narbitra divergencias de opiniones entre sus habitantes, si nos pides\nque borremos comentarios o argumentativas de otras habitantes no lo\nharemos a menos de que estas correspondan a actividades no permitidas\n(spam, propaganda partidos políticos formales, contenidos sexistas,\nracistas o de apología de otras formas de opresión).\nCada vez que publicas algo puedes elegir su grado de visibilidad. La\nopción que aparece por defecto es que puedan verlo todxs lxs\nhabitantes de las redes sociales de lorea (ver lista aquí) porque\nqueremos estimular el compartir conocimiento dentro de estas redes.\nPuedes cambiar esa opción para publicar en privado (sólo para ti),\npara tus amigxs, para una lista de amigxs, para alguno de tus grupos o\npara toda internet. Elige con cuidado y recuerda que siempre podrás\neditar esta preferencia en el futuro.\nN-1 promueve la toma de conciencia en cuanto a la finitud de los\nrecursos y pide que lxs habitantes se detengan a pensar y seleccionar\nlos archivos que suben. Recomendamos reducir su peso cuando sea\nposible y, si la información ya está alojada en un servidor de\nconfianza, compartir el enlace en lugar de volver a subirla a N-1.\n\n4.3. Compromisos de N-1 con sus habitantes.\n\nLas habitantes de N-1 son propietarias y responsables de sus datos, lo\nque significa que en cualquier momento podrán anular/borrar su cuenta\neditando los datos de su perfil y eligiendo la opción “suicidio” de su\nperfil electroníco, también pueden escribir un correo electrónico a:\nfederation [at] lorea [dot] org o contactando N1Crew.\nLa información que proporcionen no será utilizada con ninguna\nfinalidad que no sea el propio funcionamiento de la web. Eso significa\nque no compartiremos sus datos con nadie, no venderemos sus datos a\nnadie, defenderemos su privacidad en contra de cualquier intento de\nrevelarlos y no monitorearemos sus comunicaciones (más información en\napartado 3.Privacidad derivada del uso del servicio).\n\n4.4. Licencias.\n\nCada habitante de N-1 es responsable de los datos que publica en su\nperfil, su escritorio personal y dentro de los grupos a los cuales\npertenece. Le corresponde tomar en consideración los derechos de\npropiedad intelectual que puedan afectar a los contenidos que comparta.\nN-1 no se hace responsable en ningún caso de los contenidos que las\nhabitantes suben a las redes. Estos son responsabilidad exclusiva del\nhabitante que los crea. N-1 tampoco asume ningún tipo de\nresponsabilidad con el material enlazado en las redes ya sean textos,\ndocumentos, imágenes, audio o vídeo.\nLos contenidos que publiques dentro de tu perfil y escritorio personal\ntambién estarán bajo licencias libres de Creative Commons (CC-by-sa) a\nno ser que indiques otra licencia.\nPor la presente, también te comprometes a que el material que subas\nsea tuyo propio o qué cuentes con autorización del autor y/o no viole\nninguna legislación sobre copyright o la modalidad de licencia libre o\ncopyleft bajo el que ha sido publicado. Usa la publicación de enlaces\npara materiales copyright.\nEl contenido creado por la comunidad de desarrollo de N-1 está y\npermanecerá bajo las condiciones de la licencia GNU Free Documentation\nLicense (enlace y detalles).\nLos contenidos publicados dentro de los grupos y sub-grupos de Lorea,\nBughunting, Testers y usabilidad, Help están bajo licencias libres de\nCreative Commons (CC-by-sa). Eso afecta a lo que puedas escribir en\nellos. De hecho, al registrarte “aceptas” que el contenido que pongas\nen esos grupos pueda ser copiado, distribuido y publicado en otros\nmedios siempre que se reconozca tu autoría, y si se realizan obras\nderivadas de él, se haga bajo una licencia similar a ésta. Incluso se\npodrá hacer un uso comercial de lo que allí pongas, pero no seremos\nnosotros quienes ejerzamos ese derecho. Lo hacemos así para que pueda\nser utilizado sin restricciones por otros proyectos libres como la\nWikipedia por ejemplo. Y porque lo importante en Internet es *compartir*.\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: GnuPG v1.4.12 (GNU/Linux)\nComment: Using GnuPG with Mozilla - http://enigmail.mozdev.org/\n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\niKYBEeeTWQy1kU3pVjNV\n=o/8H\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\n-- \nwww.tos-dr.info // www.twitter.com/tosdr // www.github.com/Unhosted/ToS-DR\n--- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups \"Terms of Service; Didn't Read\" group.\nTo post to this group, send email to tosdr@googlegroups.com.\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send email to tosdr+unsubscribe@googlegroups.com.\nVisit this group at http://groups.google.com/group/tosdr?hl=en.\nFor more options, visit https://groups.google.com/groups/opt_out.\n\n\n"},

I prefer sending the list,\nprefixed by [GOOD] and [BAD] when I could figure it out. Each point is\nlinked to the paragraph of EUA or PP to be easily sourced.\n\nI hope somebody will be able to get it online.\n\n----- From End-User Agreement (EUA) -----\nhttps://www.spotify.com/fr/legal/end-user-agreement/ as of 2012-12-02.\n\n* [BAD] EUA is only available in the language of the country from which\nyou connect. Trying to access the english version forwards back to the\nFrench’s in my case.\n\n* [BAD] They protect themselves from anything whatsoever, putting the\nfull responsibility on the end user without explaining what the hell the\nend user is supposed to respect. For instance, in EUA §11, they simply\nsay to respect everything related to USA export acts.\n\n* [BAD] I suspect some terms to be illegal in France, which is handled\nby the EUA saying here and there: this term will be applicable in the\nextent of applicable law. It results in the inability for the end user\nto know what they can expect if they don’t know what their law allows\nand forbids.\n\n* [BAD] If they change the price of the subscription, they warn you, but\nthey state no delay. So, if they change the day before your renewal,\nyou’ll be charged the new price. (EUA §12-3)\n\n* [GOOD] You can unsubscribe from the web page (EUA §12)\n\n* [BAD] You will never be refunded (EUA §13) and if you have any problem\nwhatsoever, uninstall the software is your only possible action (EUA\n§15). I deduce you should never subscribe for more than a month.\n\n* [BAD] There is no guarantee of quality of service. Should the service\nnot be delivered, you still pay. In the extent of applicable law.\n\n* [BAD] Your data are accessible to trading parties (EUA §7). Nature of\nsuch data isn’t defined in EUA.\n\n* Special offers, community access to customer service may use different\nagreements (EUA §16). Such agreements cannot contradict this EUA. It\nmeans you should always keep an eye on them, but I can’t decide whether\nit’s good or bad.\n\n* [BAD] You grant perpetual license to use anything you publish. While\nthe global license expires when you unsubscribe, public content will\nremain licensed and will not be deleted (EUA §6-1). If law permits, you\nrenounce to requiring your content to be deleted.\n\n* [BAD] They can close your account without notice, without refund and\nwithout reason (EUA §6).\n\nAn end-user will easily find and understand the main point of the\naggreement: they can do whatever they want, you pay and shut up. There\nis no summary at the top of agreements.\n\n\n\n----- From Privacy Policy (PP) -----\nhttps://www.spotify.com/fr/legal/privacy-policy/ as of 2012-12-02.\n\n* [GOOD] Personal data is described in PP §2. If you connect from\nFacebook, they’ll get many more data.\n\n* [BAD] PP §2.2 about “transactional information allowing the management\nof digital rights” in imprecise and allows for everything to be\ncollected until a court judges is shouldn’t have been. French version: «\ninformations transactionnelles permettant la gestion des droits\nnumériques ».\n\n* [BAD] PP §2.4 states that billing is processed by external company.\nWithout knowing who, impossible to know what data they’ll keep.\n\n* [GOOD] PP §2.4 states that billing companies only sends limited\ninformation to Spotify.\n\n* PP §2.6 about special events says addition data will be merged into\nyour profile for later reuse.\n\n* PP §3 defines intended use of your personal information. Too long to\nreproduce here.\n\n* They make extended use of social networks to promote the service (PP\n§4). It can be disabled (not explained how). They’ll keep the token to\naccess your FB account anytime.\n\n* [GOOD] They warn about the use third party application may do of your\npersonal data if you permit it (PP §4.3). They’ll do their best to make\nthem unable to identify you, unless you allow it.\n\n* [BAD] They may need external companies to get the outmost of your\npersonal data, in which case they would apply undefined confidentiality\npolicies. PP §4.4 is weak (incomplete and imprecise).\n\n* [BAD] They don’t plan to inform you if they need to give your personal\ninformation to court (PP §4.5)\n\n* [GOOD] PP §5 insists on the risks of having public information.\n\n* [FEAR] They may transfer your data outside of EU. You “expressly\naccept this term”. The way PP §6 is written is quite fearful. It is not\nsaid if they will comply with law, as personal data cannot moved out of\nEU without it being allowed by EU or with drastic protection protocol in\nthe case of France.\n\n* They do not ensure data security. While the term 8 starts in a good\nway: they commit to protect data, it ends with: we don’t guarantee we’ll\nsucceed. Well, it’s a reality, so is it bad or good to state it? I’d say\nit’s good, but the shortness of the term doesn’t state they really want\nto protect data.\n\n* [GOOD] PP changes are notified though the service.\n\n\n\n"},

I hope some of you will read.  I was pleasantly \nsurprised when I stumbled on your group.  I really like the work you're \ndoing and would like to share my experiences with www.clearware.org.\n \nI started Clearware with similar motivations.  At the time there was alot \nof Internet buzz abot spyware and adware.  Google had launched their Stop \nBadware campaign.  There were various viewpoints on what constituted \nbadware.  Was it the fact that software did all the things consumers didn't \nwant like popup ads, collect personal information or other potentially \nunwanted behavior?  Or, was it deceptive practices and not disclosing these \nbehaviours in ToS or end user license agreements?  Concensus was the \ndeciding factor for \"badware\" is not disclosing these facts in ToS or \nEULAs.  Some argued this would give adware and spyware vendors a \"get out \nof jail\" card and allow them to continue these practices with near impunity \nso long as they disclosed their practices in the EULAs.\n \nAs you and I know... burying these terms in leagalize barely constitutes \ninformed consent.  These EULAs and ToS are not intended to be user friendly \nand some argue are intentionally confusing to continue the deception.  \nRegardless, we need a consumer friendly approach to EULAs and ToS.\n \nI first considered proposing standardized language or terms in EULAs with \nthe hopes this would create some consitency amongst EULAs.  I discussed \nwith people like Ben Edelman and eventually dicided this would likely not \nbe flexible enough for layers.  Frankly, I didn't want to propose language \nthat could be used by software vendors to restrict or limit consumer \nfreedoms.\n \nI thought about voluntary seals that vendors could use like those from \nTrustee but felt this could be easily abused.  I continued brainstorming \nand had some great discussions with Ren Bucholz from the EFF.  I then \ndecided on the idea of labels for software (or websites) just like there \nare nutrition facts on food, warnings for hazard materials or care labels \non clothing.  A vendor could use these labels to describe important terms \nof their EULAs or ToS.  The idea is not to replace the EULA or ToS but to \nhilight what's important to consumers security, privacy and user \nexperience.  If a vendor voluntarily provided these labels they would be \nhelp liable for them to be accurate based on advertising laws that exist in \nvarious countries and regions.  If a vendor did not provide a label \nthey could be created by the community and stored in a clearing house.  \nAlthough crowd sourced labels don't have any legal backing I believe the \ncommunity would be effective at policing the accuracy of the labels.\n \nIn adition to a user friendly label, I was devising an XML based label that \ncould be used to programatically display a label.  For example, a utility \ncould exist that monitors the installation of all software on a computer.  \nOnce this utility detects the XML label it could present the label to the \nuser for clarification and prompt for action (ie. do you agree?).  A user \ncould even set pre-defined preferences that says \"do not agree\" if the \nsoftware contains certain characteristics and the software installation \ncould be blocked.  One developer I discussed with was planning to include \nthis in an Anti-virus/anti-adware software they were creating.  Better yet, \nthis could be part of the OS for the installation of software.\n \nClearware was also mentioned in the dissertation of a Ph.D student in \nSweden(?) on the topic of Badware.\n \nMy initial comment regarding ToS;DR is that the rating scheme seems to \nsubjective.  The scale may be based on the judgement of the person creating \nthe rating.  Two people rating a ToS may come up with different ratings and \nthis may lead to confusion.  At the time Stop Badware started, adware and \nother potentially unwanted software was bundled with utilities that people \nactually wanted like games, screensavers or other utilities.  It's \nconceivable that people want Facebook or other similar services to share \ntheir location or other personal information with others because they want \nthe function that the application provides.  What's may be considered \nunwanted by one reviewer is wanted by another.

How we collect and use personal information.*\n*\"When you sign up for a Spotify account or purchase Spotify’s products and \nservices described on the Spotify Websites or access the Spotify Service, \nwe may ask you for and collect certain information such as email address, \npostal address, age, gender residence and the URL of the website from which \nyou are signing up.\"*\n\nFairly straight forward and common stuff to do. Needed to verify that the \ncustomer is who he/she is and for statistics/marketing purposes. \nThe second part how ever.\n\n*\"When creating a Spotify account, or connecting your already existing \nSpotify account with your Facebook account, we will also receive and store \nthe following information from Facebook Ireland Limited (“**Facebook**”) \nyour name, user name, **password**, profile picture, unique Facebook \nidentifier and access token, gender, birthday and email address.\"*\n\nIf you register as a Spotify customer today, you will need to sign in with \nyour Facebook account. And when you do this they will receive your password \nun-encrypted (To be able to handle authentication by them self) from \nFacebook Ireland Limited (At least that is what I take home from this vague \ndescription).\n\nAnd continues with fairly unspecific on what data they gather while you \naccess their services and for what purpose.\n\n*\"In addition, when you use the Spotify Software Application, Spotify \nService and Spotify Websites, we will automatically receive information \nabout your use of the application, service and website including \ninformation such as media that you access, queries you make, the URL of the \nwebsite from which you use or access the Spotify Service, date and time of \nyour request, your Internet protocol address, performance of your network \nand computer, your browser type, language and identifying information, your \noperating system and application version.\"*\n\nThe first part also mentions the use of the data gathered. Still this is \nfairly straight forward. At least as far at Privacy Policies go :)\n\n*\"We will use your personal information (i) to provide the products and \nservices that you have purchased or requested (including Spotify Social, as \ndefined in the Spotify Terms and Conditions of Use, and the display of \ncustomized content and advertising), (ii) to communicate with you \nconcerning your account, customer service issues and other Spotify products \nand services, (iii) to personalize and improve the Spotify Software \nApplication, the Spotify Service and the Spotify Websites, (iv) to ensure \nthe technical functioning of our products and services, (v) to develop new \nproducts and services, (vi) to protect the copyright-protected content of \nthe Spotify Service (e.g. by limiting access to the Spotify Service content \nto users with a Spotify account), and (vii) as otherwise stated in this \nSpotify Privacy Policy.\"*\n\nThey are also kind enough to be a bit more specific on how they share your \nFacebook information. \n\n*\"If you connect your Spotify account to Facebook, we will make available \nand/or share your Facebook user name and your Facebook profile picture to \nother Spotify users. Further, Spotify users may be able to use the Spotify \nService to search for or view your Spotify profile and the information \ncontained therein, such as Playlists, as defined below (for example, if \nthey know and input your user name in the Spotify Software Application or \nSpotify Service).\"*\n\nAnd they do asks us to familiarize our selves with their privacy settings \nwithin the Spotify client.\n*\"Please familiarize yourself with and use the settings in the preferences \npane as they provide you with some options to adjust the information in \nyour Spotify profile that may be viewed and your activities that may be \nshared.\"*\n\nAnd also they almost write the last part of section 1 as a warning.\n*\"If you choose to activate Spotify Social or otherwise publish your \nplaylists, starred music top lists, and current playing song (hereafter \njointly “Playlists”), your Playlist information will be publicly available \nto other Spotify users (for example, on your Spotify profile page or social \nactivity stream) and may be used, or re-shared by other Spotify users. \nSpotify is not responsible for the use or re-sharing of Playlist \ninformation by others once it is made public. If you do not wish for such \nuse or re-sharing of this type of data taking place going forward, you \nshould not activate Spotify Social and/or adjust your settings and \nlistening mode.\"*\n\n*Section 2: Sharing information with others.*\n\n*I quit work for today so i will follow this up tomorrow at work :)*\n*Please comment any thoughts you have on the first section .*\n\n-- \nwww.tos-dr.info // www.twitter.com/tosdr // www.github.com/Unhosted/ToS-DR\n--- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups \"Terms of Service; Didn't Read\" group.\nTo post to this group, send email to tosdr@googlegroups.com.\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send email to tosdr+unsubscribe@googlegroups.com.\nVisit this group at http://groups.google.com/group/tosdr?hl=en.\nFor more options, visit https://groups.google.com/groups/opt_out.\n\n\n"},

When we receive requests \nlike this, we'll only release your personal information if we have a \ngood faith belief that the law requires us to do so. Nothing in this \npolicy is intended to limit any legal defenses or objections that you \nmay have to a third party's request to disclose your information.\n\nIf our organizational structure or status changes (if we undergo a \nrestructuring, are acquired, or go bankrupt) we may pass your \ninformation to a successor or affiliate.\n\nHere are some good things in their privacy statement:\n\nWe also don't want your personal information for any longer than we need\n it, so we only keep it long enough to do what we collected it for. Once\n we don't need it, we take steps to destroy it unless we are required by\n law to keep it longer.\n\nIf we store your personal information with information that is \nnon-personal, we will consider the combination as personal information. \nIf we remove all personal information from a set of data then the \nremaining is non-personal information.\n\nSince Mozilla is an organization, they have many services that each have their own privacy policy.

The European Commission has spoken in favour of the «right to be forgotten» ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-16677370 ).\n\nI don't care that much about whether I can unsubscribe (nowadays I don't subscribe if I cannot leave), what I want is *all* of my private data to be removed from online services databases, according to the EU proposal. So your work might be interesting in dissecting online  services terms and conditions but the most important features to me are:\n- does the site allow for unsubscribing? (one bad point for \"no\")\n- are private data actually erased? (*ten* bad points if both are \"no\")\n\nAs a once member of LinkedIn I can witness despite their apparent \"friendliness\" about unsubscribing, there's no direct clue private data will be permanently deleted. On the contrary, there are irrefutable clues private email addresses (and whatnot) remain in their databases after unsubscribing. You can actually receive promotional messages from LinkedIn *after* you unsubscribe, which proves they hold at least your email address for an unadvertised period of time.\n\nWorse, if you ask them to not receive any of those promotional messages they will just *add* your email address to another list of people who wish not to receive anything! This makes *twice* as many chances to get your email address (who knows what more they keep?) being at risk, e.g. during a system break-in attempt, just like the one which was recently reported to have compromised about six million accounts!\n\nSo far to me, unless I'm proved the contrary (will be hard, I know that), the only way to get your private data out of online services is to *not* subscribe. *This* is where the *real* fight needs to take place to me actually.\n\nGood day people,\nVince C.\n\n-- \nwww.tos-dr.info // www.twitter.com/tosdr // www.github.com/Unhosted/ToS-DR\n--- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups \"Terms of Service; Didn't Read\" group.\nTo post to this group, send email to tosdr@googlegroups.com.\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send email to tosdr+unsubscribe@googlegroups.com.\nVisit this group at http://groups.google.com/group/tosdr?hl=en.\nFor more options, visit https://groups.google.com/groups/opt_out.\n\n\n"},

I came across your profile on Linkedin whilst searching for people who work in Google's HR department. I had come across two job openings on Google's website but it has been my experience that when searching for jobs it is best to connect with a person at a company rather than going through the automated resume submission. \n\nThere are two openings, both within the Legal & Government Relations Team, at Google I am interested in: The first is as a Legal Assistant in the Global Ethics and Compliance group (http://www.google.com/about/jobs/locations/mountain-view/legal-public-policy/legal-assistant-global-ethics-and-compliance-mountain-view.html) and the second in Online Legal Support (http://www.google.com/about/jobs/locations/mountain-view/legal-public-policy/legal-assistant-online-legal-support-mountain-view.html).\n\nI believe I am qualified for both Jobs. I have a law degree which has taught me to rigorously analyze legal issues and communicate them succinctly orally and verbally. I have always been interested how technological innovation influences the development of laws and regulations. During law school I wrote a research paper discussing how Google's technology is outside the realm of traditional business models, and traditional taxation methods based upon these, which subsequently enables Google to minimize its tax rate significantly. This research paper, which was a major component of the coursework, led me to receive the highest grade for the course and I believe it illustrates my interest in the topic and Google.\n\nI am interested in working for Google for a number of different reasons. As previously mentioned, Google's world-changing technology is one of the main reasons but Google's corporate culture is also very appealing to me. Google's embrace of global, open-information, democratic ideals in it's corporate mission statement, coupled with the do no evil mantra makes it a very attractive employer. \n\nFurthermore, I have a very international background. I am bilingual in English and German; I have studied and worked in both languages, please see my resume for more details. Additionally, having moved to different countries has helped me develop insights into cultural differences and a flexibility to thrive and learn quickly under various diverse circumstances. I believe this qualifies me well for the second job in Online Legal Support. \n\nI work well in high-pressure and team environments and have a track record of being very diligent and detail oriented. Please feel free to contact any of my references. \n\nI have recently relocated to the Bay Area and I'm searching for employment opportunities beginning immediately. I'm a legal resident of the U.S. and do not require and work permit/visa sponsorship. \n\nThank you very much and I look forward to hearing back from you soon.\n\nKind Regards,\n\nAndi\n\n\n\n-- \nwww.tos-dr.info // www.twitter.com/tosdr // www.github.com/Unhosted/ToS-DR\n--- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups \"Terms of Service; Didn't Read\" group.\nTo post to this group, send email to tosdr@googlegroups.com.\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send email to tosdr+unsubscribe@googlegroups.com.\nVisit this group at http://groups.google.com/group/tosdr?hl=en.\nFor more options, visit https://groups.google.com/groups/opt_out.\n\n\n"},

In the third clause, you have mis-spelled solicit as \"sollicit\", and in the fifth one, you have written \"Facebok\" instead of \"Facebook\".\nNow I know these are small mistakes, but I think coming from a law student (if I am not mistaken about your project lead's profession), it looks a bit un-professional.

And anonymizing is not very easy technically, so should\nbe done with some care, and by people who know what they're doing,\nbefore any logs are published to marketing departments or third\nparties etcetera.\n\nright now, the default is that you're being tracked all the time, and\nthis creates a slippery slope. if we promote privacy by default, then\nusers can still opt-in to be counted in tracking experiments. this\nalso relates to the DoNotTrack header, i guess?\n\njust had a discussion with Hugo and Erkan about this, Hugo in\nparticular doesn't at all agree with me that this is a consumer's\nright we should be defending... curious how important other people\nfind this topic!\n\nCheers,\nMichiel\n"},

But Jasper’s conversion into a\nprivacy true believer began earlier, with a less-discussed subpoena: one\nregarding a pornographic film with an unprintable title.\n\nEighteen months ago, Sonic.net began to see a string of legal requests\nfor its users’ data, mostly for copyright infringement cases involving\nx-rated films with embarrassing names: When given the option to settle\nor have their name attached to a smutty video in a legal case, Jasper\nsaw users paying up–even when they seemed to be innocent.\n\nSo he took an unprecedented step to protect the privacy of his 40,000 or\nso Northern California customers: He cut the time that his ISP stores\nlogs of users’ Internet activity to just two weeks–a tiny period\ncompared to the 18-36 months ISPs like Verizon, AT&T, Qwest, Cox,\nComcast and Time Warner hold onto users’ private information.\n\nI sat down with Jasper in his Santa Rosa office to talk about his stance\nas a privacy pragmatist, the landmark WikiLeaks case he’s been involved\nin, and why major ISPs refuse to follow his move to cut data retention\ntimes. Here’s an edited transcript of our conversation.\n\nAndy Greenberg: It seems like you’ve made a point of trying to become\nthe most privacy-preserving Internet service provider (ISP) in operation\nin the United States.\n\nDane Jasper: We have.\n\nAG: Can you tell me what are the concrete ways you’ve done that?\n\nDJ: So, we’ve stood up for our customers, at our expense, when we had an\noption not to. We’ve demonstrated a willingness to put our money where\nour mouth is, and spend resources where we felt it was warranted to\nlegally defend our customers. And the other major thing that we’ve done\nis to make a commitment to limit our logging interval.\n\nAG: What’s your limit?\n\nDJ: We limit it to two weeks.\n\nAG: Is that the shortest that you know of?\n\nDJ: No, some VPN providers commit to no logs. But it’s the shortest\nretention period of any facilities-based Internet access provider that I\nknow of, yes. Comcast or AT&T or Verizon typically keep their logs for\n18 to 36 months.\n\nAG: And why did you make that decision?\n\nDJ: So, what we saw was a shift towards customers being made part of a\nbusiness model that involved–I don’t know if extortion is the right\nword–but embarassment for gain.\nAn individual would download a movie, using bittorrent, and infringe\ncopyright. And that might be our customer, like Bob Smith who owns a\nSonic.net account, or it might be their spouse, or it might be their\nchild. Or it might be one of his three roommates in a loft in San\nFrancisco, who Bob is not responsible for, and who rent out their loft\non AirBnB and have couch surfers and buddies from college and so on and\nopen Wifi.\n\nWhen lawyers asked us for these users’ information, some of our\ncustomers I spoke with said “Oh yeah, crap, they caught me,” and were\nwilling to admit they engaged in piracy and pay a settlement. But in\nother cases, it turned out the roommate did it, or no one would admit to\ndoing it. But they would pay the settlement anyway. Because no one wants\nto be named in the public record in a case from So-And-So Productions\nvs. 1,600 names including Bob Smith for downloading a film called “Don’t\nTell My Wife I B—F—— The Babysitter.”\n\nAG: Is that a real title?\n\nDJ: Yes. I’ve read about cases where a lawyer was doing this for the\nmovie “The Expendables,” and 5% of people settled. So then he switched\nto representing someone with an embarassing porn title, and like 30% of\npeople paid.\n\nIt seemed like half the time, the customer wasn’t the one right one, but\nthey rolled over because it would be very embarassing. And I think\nthat’s an abuse of process. I was unwilling to become part of that\nbusiness model. In many cases the lawyers never pursued the case, and it\nwas all bluster. But under that threat, you pay.\n\nAG: So when did you decide to limit data retention?\n\nDJ: Well, we saw a big uptake in this problem early last year. The\n“Don’t Tell My Wife” one was the first, and we laughed about it. But\nthen we saw more and more coming in. So I looked at this, and it was a\ncynical, awful business.\n\nI met with my system team, and I said, why are we keeping these logs?\nThe primary reasons were law enforcement and spam, so we looked at our\nlaw enforcement subpoenas, and the spam processing. In the case of spam,\nsomeone is infected and becomes part of a botnet, somebody kicks off a\nspam job and the customer dumps 20,000 emails in a day. We get\ncomplaints, and they’re all about the last day. My systems team also\nonly needed logs for a day.\n\nSo then I looked at law enforcement subpoenas and tried to balance an\nability to help law enforcement when it’s morally right to do so with an\ninability to help anybody beyond a certain window. In the civil\ncopyright cases, we’d get a subpoena from them anywhere from 30-90 days\nlater, sometimes longer after the alleged act of piracy has occurred.\n\nWe were concerned about cases where there’s a kidnapping, a threat to\nthe human life, and the FBI is trying to find the kidnapper who sent a\ndemand email yesterday or a week ago. We felt like two weeks was a good\nwindow that would allow us to address some things–both our own needs in\nthe long term and the law enforcement’s dire needs in the mid-term–while\nomitting any ability to assist in what we felt was like an extortion\nracket. And so that was another concrete step we took last year, to\nreduce our logging interval to two weeks.\n\nAG: What was it before?\n\nDJ: Some things we kept for 30 days, other things for years. We didn’t\nhave a defined procedure.\n\nAG: Earlier, you mentioned fighting legal battles on behalf of your\nusers. Can you say specifically what battles and which customers?\n\nDJ: I probably can’t. I can tell you that the case you’ve probably read\nabout regarding Jacob Appelbaum is under seal, and I can’t comment on\nthat case. And obviously Appelbaum spoke with the Wall Street Journal\nreporter and reported that we informed him that we managed to get it\nunsealed enough to inform him. So, however the entire case is still\nunder seal, so we can’t speak to the specific sides informing him.\n\nWe’ve committed to and published a policy of notification of customers\nwhen their data is subpoenaed. The typical subpoena that we will get\nwill say “This is an ongoing investigation, and to protect the integrity\nof the investigation, we request that you please not inform your\ncustomer about the details of this subpoena while complying with it, now\nor ever.” Sometimes they’ll say “and if you are or do tell your\ncustomer, tell us that you have.”\n\nI’m ok with that second part. but I’m not ok with the first. If\nsomething belongs under a seal, they should make that case to the judge.\nI shouldn’t be in the role of deciding whether or not someone should be\ninformed about a law enforcement request for their information. So we\ninstead say, “Here’s our policy document, we notify our customers, if\nthat’s a problem for your investigation, you should make that case to a\njudge and put it under seal.”\n\nAG: In Appelbaum’s case, did you actually have the seal raised or did\nyou violate the seal?\n\nDJ: We were unable to get the case unsealed, we were able to unseal it\nto a degree that we were allowed to inform our customer about compliance\nwith the subpoena.\n\nAG: Are there cases where you’ve fought not just to tell your customer\nabout the subpoena but actually quash it, as Twitter is attempting to do\nin the case of Occupy Wall Street protestor Malcolm Harris?\n\nDJ: I have to answer carefully. I can’t say anything specific about the\nAppelbaum case, so I can’t comment on whether we did or didn’t fight the\nrelease of his data. The only thing that we are able to say is to him is\nthat we were forced to hand over his data.\n\nAG: Did the Appelbaum case help convince you to limit your data\nretention?\n\nDJ: I would answer that in a general way. All of the subpoenas that we\nreceive from the various branches of law enforcement and all of the\ncivil cases that we’ve processed over the last few years have all\ncontributed to my outlook on privacy, and so I don’t want to say that\nthere’s a cause and effect between those things. I will say that\neverything that we have received has been contributory towards our\nposition around privacy.\n\nAG: If your ISP is able to operate with only two weeks of logging, why\ncan’t others like Comcast, AT&T, Verizon and Time Warner?\n\nDJ: They should. I think ISPs need to minimize their logging to a degree\nthat it works within their business, notify customers about subpoenas\nand, where subpoenas warrant resistance after review, they should resist\nthem.\n\nAG: Why don’t they?\n\nDJ: I could only speculate. Costs. The cost is legal friction and\nlawyers.\n\nAG: I’m sure it’s expensive to fight these legal battles over subpoenas.\nBut what about logging for just two weeks? That’s not expensive.\n\nDJ: I would speculate it would be an unpopular move that might result in\nmore friction with law enforcement. Law enforcement has been lobbying to\npass laws that would require service providers to keep 18-36 months of\nlogs. It’s in their interests.\n\nAG: Do ISPs keep the logs that long voluntarily to avoid being\nlegislated to do so?\n\nDJ: Or just to be cooperative. They’re running a business. Picking a\nfight with law enforcement isn’t part of their business model.\n\nAs a small provider, we can make an independent decision like this and\nit doesn’t matter in the overall ecosystem. But if a very large carrier\nmade that decision, it would be much discussed. And potentially\nlegislated.\n\nAG: Have you faced friction with law enforcement as a result of your\nlogging policy?\n\nDJ: No. We’ve heard some expressions of surprise. But if they’re not\nasking us for data, they’re asking web hosts, websites, or email service\nproviders.\n\nI think we had one customer that wrote to us and said “Don’t protect the\nterrorists. Log everything you can. I don’t care about my privacy,\nbecause I’m not a terrorist.” But I think that that’s too simple away of\nlooking at it.\n\nAG: Do you think your privacy policy could be a business advantage? Do\nyou market yourselves that way?\n\nDJ: If you look at the marketing material, you won’t see us pitching\nthis as a feature, and that’s intentional. I’m trying to protect my\ncustomers. The overall public. Not the self-selected subset who buys a\nservice because they especially care about their privacy, or are an\nactivist, or help some greater concern. I don’t think I can provide them\nadequate protection. Two weeks of logs is two weeks of logs. If they are\na Chinese dissident living in the US they should be using Tor or\nsomething.\n\nOn the other hand, if I say to the public “Hey, this is a great place\nbecause we keep less logs,” I don’t want to attract people who want to\nbreak the law, and then find that we don’t have the data and they don’t\nget caught.\n\nSo I don’t think it’s appropriate to market on that basis. I think it’s\nappropriate to do it, but not to market it.\n\nAG: Services like VPNs and proxies clearly build competitive advantage\nout of privacy, don’t they?\n\nDJ: Are they really?  I think it’s a cynical perversion. They are using\nprivacy as an excuse to create a product that if you were really to get\ntheir true feelings about it, sells more because of piracy. They create\na mechanism to enable piracy through total anonymity and they end up\nselling a lot of connections or VPN tunnels, or whatever their “privacy\nproduct” is. And I think that’s fraught with risk as well. It’s through\nthat sort of exploitation of copyright holders that you’re going to get\nlegislation around log retention.\n\nAG: You’ve talked a lot about the effects of the lack of competition\namong ISPs in the U.S. Do you think that monopolistic environment is one\nreason that none of them has a privacy policy like yours?\n\nDJ: If we had a true open access and a vibrant competitive environment,\nit would fix lots of problems. The whole network neutrality issue, that\nwhole fight is not an issue if you had 30 service providers to choose\nfrom, because if one was goofing with your voice over IP, everybody\nwould leave.\n\nSimilarly, if there were 30 service providers to choose from in every\nmarket, I think everyone would take better care of consumers’ privacy,\ntoo.\n\nIn the US, we made a shift in 2002 and decided that we were going to\npick winners in each industry, and we’re going to have the incumbent\ncable company compete with the incumbent phone company, and maybe the\npower company will get into the business, and then there’ll be some\nwireless, and maybe satellite. But realistically, wireless is expensive\nand slow. Satellite is latent. Broadband over powerlines never really\nworked. So you end up with two to choose from, and if you only have two,\none looks at the other, and they go, that guy is this fast, lets be that\nfast. That guy is $25 let’s be $20.\n\nAG: That guy logs 18 to 36 months. Why shouldn’t we?\n\nDJ: Right. Why do we want to pick a fight with law enforcement, or lobby\ncongress, argue to pass laws about logging? So in a duopoly environment\nyou get a number of effects that aren’t beneficial to consumers.\n\nIn an environment where you’ve got 30 providers to choose from, do\nprivacy policies naturally improve? They might.\n\n \n\n\nThis article is available online at: \nhttp://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2012/06/22/ceo-of-internet-provider-sonic-net-we-delete-user-logs-after-two-weeks-your-internet-provider-should-too/\n-- \nHugo Roy \n  French Coordinator, FSFE       chat: hugo@jabber.fsfe.org\n  www.fsfe.org/about/roy         mobile: +336 08 74 13 41\n                                 mobile DE: +49 151 143 56 563\n\n-- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups \"Terms of Service; Didn&#39;t Read\" group.\nTo post to this group, send email to tosdr@googlegroups.com.\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send email to tosdr+unsubscribe@googlegroups.com.\nFor more options, visit https://groups.google.com/groups/opt_out.\n\n\n"},

While I agree \nwith that distinction, I would like to discuss with you what makes you choose \nbetween a \"thumbs down\" and a \"red cross\" for a certain type of clause in a \nTOS. \n\nOne particular clause, unfortunately frequent, in TOS's is \"Terms may be \nchanged any time at their discretion, without notice to the user\". You seem to \nclassify that as \"thumbs down\", and this mail is my attempt to convince you \nthat it should be a \"red cross\". Accepting such a clause - at least some \nwordings of it, when it states something like \"you're bound to the latest \nversion of the TOS of this service\" - means you're in fact signing a blank \ncontract: a contract where the other part - the service - can write whatever \nit wants *after* you sign, and you're bound to it. *That* should be a red \ncross: at any time the service can change the complete terms of services to \n\"red crosses items\", and you've accepting it without knowing... \n\nA practical example: Yahoo! doesn't have any red crosses, but it has a \"Terms \nmay be changed any time at their discretion, without notice to the user\" item. \nWhich in practical terms means that tomorrow, their terms can be something \nlike:\n* All your content is (c) Yahoo!\n* We won't inform Government requests\n* We can suspend your account whenever we want for whatever reason we want, \n  without any kind of explanation\n* No pseudonyms allowed\n* You cannot delete your account\n* Deleted content isn't really deleted\n\nOr, in other words, that clause only implies you're automaticly and without \nknowing signing - possibly, if that's the service's will - an \"all red \ncrosses\" Class E TOS...\n\nDo you agree?\n\nBest regards,\n-- \nMarcos Marado\n\n-- \nwww.tos-dr.info // www.twitter.com/tosdr // www.github.com/didnotread\n--- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups \"Terms of Service; Didn't Read\" group.\nTo post to this group, send email to tosdr@googlegroups.com.\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send email to tosdr+unsubscribe@googlegroups.com.\nVisit this group at http://groups.google.com/group/tosdr?hl=en.\nFor more options, visit https://groups.google.com/groups/opt_out.\n\n\n"},

It's definitely not easy to find out how to, but when\nyou know it's as simple as this. What I did:\n\n- Write an e-mail to contactus@skype.net, tell them you want to delete\nyour account\n\n- You'll get a reply asking you some questions in order to prove your\nidentity (i.e. two telephone numbers you recently called, the date and\nsum of your last purchase, the payment method you used, the e-mail\naddress you used when you first registered with Skype).\n\n- After identifying yourself you'll get a confirmation like this:\n\"We can confirm that your Skype account has now been canceled in\naccordance with your recent request. This is effective immediately and\nthe time period for removing your Skype Name from the search directory\nis usually short, however, sometimes it may take up to two weeks. This\nis a technical delay, which is out of Skype’s control.\"\n\nHurrah!

A few things I'm wondering about...\n\n\n   1. There's a \"type\" attribute on services, that's almost always set to \n   \"service\". Should this always be set to service and a \"type\": \"point\" \n   introduced to points, or is this meant to track a different metric (eg: \n   eulas) in the future? Right now, to avoid overwriting \"type\" I'm needing \n   to make a new \"datatype\": \"service\" or \"point\" for import to Couch. Is that \n   something that should be in the original *.json files, or is it pointless?\n   2. Why do so many points not have full attributes (especially \"service\" \n   attributes)? Is this list automatically generated?\n   3.

I'm sorry for\nanyone's inbox overfilling.\n\nI tag things as [good][bad][ugly][info] throughout. Ugly is the stuff\nthat bites you. Info may or may not be relevant, or may be commentary.\n\nTL;DR: I'd give them a B. The \"Minecraft\" entry needs to be changed to\n\"Mojang\" because the second part below also applies to Cobalt and\nScrolls, possibly 0x10c as well.\n\nIANAL, so back up the salt truck.\n\nMinecraft's TOS is pretty lean, and has some interesting subtleties,\nbut it has a big bit of legalese behind it thanks to Mojang\n\nfrom http://www.minecraft.net/terms\n\n> As we at Mojang strive towards releasing updates for our projects we cannot guarantee that any project will ever be completed and/or provided support for. There's always the risk of a project being discontinued at any time.\n\nRead: Minecraft might go away. There's been a subtle, quiet promise\nthat the source will be released at some further time:\n\n> Once sales start dying and a minimum time has passed, I will release the game source code as some kind of open source. I'm not very happy with the draconian nature of (L)GPL, nor do I believe the other licenses have much merit other than to boost the egos of the original authors, so I might just possibly release it all as public domain.\n( http://www.minecraft.net/game )\n\nMajor points:\n\n * [good] Free to mod the game ( \"you may play around with it and modify it\" )\n * [good] Unlike some (read: StarCraft) the stuff you make is yours\n(\"Any tools you write for the game from scratch belongs to you\")\n * [bad] Can't monetize your mods ( \"Plugins for the game also belong\nto you and you can do whatever you want with them, as long as you\ndon't sell them for money.\")\n * [ugly] Its not your call what your mod qualifies as (\"We reserve\nthe final say regarding what constitutes a tool/plugin and what\ndoesn't.\")\n * [ugly] TOS can change w/o retroactivity (\"We reserve the right to\nchange this agreement at any time with or without notice, with\nimmediate and/or retroactive effect.\")\n * [good] Promise of transparency (\"We're trying to be open and\nhonest, and we hope people treat us the same way back.\")\n * [info] Legal problems handled on case-by-case basis (\"If there's\nanything legal you're wondering about that isn't answered from this\npage, don't do it and ask us about it.\")\n * [info] Jurisdiction of Sweden.\n * [good] Removal of personal details (\"You have the right, according\nto the law Personuppgiftslagen (PUL) in Sweden to know about the\ninformation registered about you. If it is wrong, insufficient or\nirrelevant you have the right to make sure that it gets corrected or\nremoved.\")\n\n\nHowever...  This TOS is apparently overridden by the official Mojang\none, which is a much more complex, legalese document, found at\nhttps://account.mojang.com/terms and which has a very nice TL;DR:\n\n * Our games are usually made available during development and will\ncontain errors and bugs.\n\n [info] Games may contain bugs.\n\n * Do not redistribute our games or any alterations of our game files.\n\n[info] Don't pirate things.\n\n * You may develop tools, plug-ins and services for commercial use but\nthey may not seem official, such as using our logos. Do not make\ncommercial use of anything we've made without our permission.\n\n[info] You're not allowed to use their branding unless they say otherwise\n\n * We are trying to be open, honest and trusting with the hope that\nyou hold us in the same regard.\n\n[good] Open communication\n\nhere's what they have to say (with the standard \"you're here so you\nagree with this\" boilerplate stuff taken out, look for [...])\n\nUpdated: 29 June 2012 11:07\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThese terms and conditions incorporates the terms of use for the\nmojang.com webite, our end user license agreement, our brand and asset\nusage guidelines, and our privacy policy. By agreeing to these terms\nand conditions you also agree to all parts of these four documents, so\nplease read through them carefully. If you are young and you are\nhaving trouble understanding these terms and conditions, please ask a\nresponsible adult such as your parent or guardian. Remember to check\nback here once in a while because we might change these terms and\nconditions.\n\n[info] they want people to understand their TOS.\n\nIf there‘s anything legal you‘re wondering about that isn‘t answered\nfrom this page, don‘t do it. Basically, don‘t be ridiculous and we\nwon‘t.\n\n[good] Open to legal questions.\n\nMOJANG.COM WEBSITE TERMS OF USE\n\n[...]\n\nREGISTRATION, ACCOUNT AND PASSWORD\n\nThe details you give us as part of the registration must be correct.\nYou can change your registration details if they become out of date.\nIf you deliberately tell us something that you know isn‘t true, and we\nend up in trouble or we lose money, we may hold you responsible. That\nmeans that you may have to compensate us for the damage you cause and\nwhat we have lost.\n\n[bad] Its your responsibility to make sure things are okay and your\nfault if it gets them in trouble.\n\nYou might need to register with us to access all of the parts of our\nWebsite. The username and password that you create are private so you\nmust keep them to yourself. If you let someone find out your username\nand password, and they do something bad with our website, we will hold\nyou responsible. You should change your password if you think someone\nelse knows what it is. If someone uses your password to do something\non our Website that you don‘t like or that causes you harm, we can‘t\nbe and aren‘t responsible.\n\n[info] Your job to keep your account details private to others\n[info] Your fault if someone breaks something in your name\n\nRIGHTS OF USE AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS\n\nYou are free to use our Website as long as you stick to these terms\nand conditions. You can only use this Website and its content for your\npersonal use. You can‘t use our Website for commercial purposes, so\ndon‘t try and make any money from the Website. Your permission to use\nthis Website is personal to you, so you can‘t give it to anyone else.\n\nDon‘t forget that we still own the Website and the content on it, but\nwe are giving you a permission to use it. We want you to enjoy using\nour Website, but if we want, we can take away your permission to use\nour Website at any time for any reason.\n\nRESTRICTIONS AND OBLIGATIONS\n\nYou aren‘t allowed to hack, decompile or change our Website at all and\nyou mustn‘t do so. This includes the code or any content or data.\nBasically, you should just leave it as it is. You also aren‘t allowed\nto create any software or content that mimics our Website. We really\ndon‘t want any of our community to get confused about which is the\nofficial Website and which is a website which someone other than us\noperates.\n\n[bad] Not allowed to handle Responsible Disclosure. [Sidenote: this is\nhard to interpret, but the language \"hack, decompile\" generally means\n\"do something mean\" but can be interpreted as \"find holes at all\"]\n\nPlease don‘t use our Website in a way which we might think is\noffensive, immoral or illegal, or makes other people feel\nuncomfortable. We don‘t want our Website to be used in a way which\nupsets people.\n\nYou also aren‘t allowed to try to make money out of using our Website.\n\nFORUM AND COMMUNICATIONS\n\nIf we are running a forum, we are just allowing members of our\ncommunity to put their thoughts on our Website. It doesn‘t mean we\nagree with those thoughts, and we can‘t be held responsible for what\npeople post on our Website.\n\n[info] They aren't responsible for what you say.\n\nIf we happen to see a post that we think is offensive, we might take\nit down, but it‘s not our job to select or moderate all the posts\npeople make. What we say about forums and posts also applies to\nanything which enables people to put any other content, views or\nmaterial on our Website or send it to others using the Website.\n\n[bad] No requirement to moderate.\n\n[...]\n\nIf you post any content on our Website, you must (and by doing so you\nactually do) give us permission to use, copy, modify and adapt that\ncontent as part of our business. This permission must be irrevocable.\nYou must also let us permit other people to use, copy, modify and\nadapt your content. If you don‘t want to give us this permission, then\nplease do not post any content on our Website. Please think carefully\nbefore you post any content, because it will be made public and might\neven be used by other people in a way you don‘t like.\n\n[bad] Content is public-domain\n\n[...]\n\nLIABILITY\n\nWhen you use our Website, you use it ‘as is‘. This means that we are\nnot making any promises to you about the standard or quality of our\nWebsite, or that our Website will be uninterrupted or error free. We\nonly promise to provide our Website and any services with reasonable\nskill and care. This means that we aren‘t responsible for any losses\nyou suffer as a result of your use of our Website.\nIf we have linked our Website to another website, it doesn‘t mean we\nhave checked that website. It just means that we think it‘s\ninteresting. We aren‘t responsible for websites linked to our Website.\n\n[good] They'll do their best however they can.\n[info] don't rely on this to be here forever.\n\nPURCHASES\n\nYou can buy games from our Website, as well as other products. In\norder to do this, our Website is integrated with third party service\nproviders. All of the things we sell on our Website are covered by\nthese terms of use as well as the terms and conditions of any of our\nthird party service providers. We try to make sure the Website only\nshows games or products that are available, but of course we can‘t\nguarantee that all of the games or products will always be available.\n\nPRICE AND PAYMENT\n\nYou have to send us the money for the game or product when you make\nthe offer to buy it. We will keep this money for you. If we accept\nyour offer, we will take that money as payment for the game or\nproduct. If we don‘t accept your offer, we will send the money back to\nyou.\nThe payment method and system is set out on our Website, but we might\nchange it every once in a while and we can refuse any form of payment\nif we want. You must always pay in the currency set out on our\nWebsite, but your credit card company should be able to exchange your\nmoney if necessary. You credit card company might do security checks\nto make sure it is really you making the order.\n\n[Author's note: this is the most confusing block of text in the TOS,\nbut one of my Swedish friends informs me it is fairly common to escrow\npurchases like this]\n\nRETURNS, REFUNDS AND CANCELLATION\n\nIf you can‘t use a game or a product because it doesn‘t work, let us\nknow and we‘ll try to help you out.\n\n[good] They help you if you need it in terms of their stuff.\n\nThe purchase of a game through our Website is a service that commences\nwhen the download of the game starts, following which you shall not be\nentitled to cancel your order for the game.\n\n[bad] No refunds.\n\nERRORS\n\nWe do what we can to make sure all of the information on our Website\nis correct. However, sometimes there might be errors. We might also\ncancel or suspend a transaction if there has been an error.\n\n[good] Promise to fix problems and revert changes if needed.\n\nPROMOTIONS\n\nSometimes we run promotions. If we do, the main rules of the promotion\nare below. There might be other rules relating to a particular\npromotion, but we will tell you about them when we tell you about the\npromotion.\n\nThe main rules are:\n\n * Only one promotion can be used at a time, and you can‘t use a\npromotion with another offer.\n * Discounts are only valid until the date specified and they only\napply to purchases made on the Website.\n * Discounts are not refundable.\n\nWe might cancel any promotion at a time.\n\n[good] Clear rules on refunds.\n\n\nGENERAL STUFF\n\nThese terms of use are subject to any legal rights you might have.\nNothing in these terms and conditions will limit any of your rights\nthat may not be excluded under law nor shall it exclude or limit our\nliability for death or personal injury resulting from our negligence\nnor any fraudulent representation.\n\n[info] This gets overruled by any local law.\n\nWe can change these terms of use at any time. We don‘t need to tell\nyou about the changes for them to have effect, and the effect could be\nretrospective. You should check back here from time to time so you are\naware of any changes to these terms of use.\n\n[info] TOS can change without notice.\n[bad] don't have to tell you about changes\n[ugly] Users job to find updates.\n\nIf you come to us with a suggestion for any one of our Websites or\ngames, that suggestion is made for free. This means we can use your\nsuggestion in any way we want and we don‘t have to pay you for it. If\nyou think you have a suggestion that we would be willing to pay you\nfor, you must tell us you expect to be paid before you tell us the\nsuggestion.\n\n[info] Your suggestions can be their ideas.\n[good] You can get paid for your suggetions.\n\nGENERAL END USER LICENCE AGREEMENT\n\nIn order to protect the games that we sell through www.mojang.com\n(each of which is referred to in these terms as our “Game”) and the\nmembers of our community, we need these end user licence terms to set\nout some rules for downloading and using our Game. We don‘t like rules\nany more than you do, so we have tried to keep this as short as\npossible. If you break these rules we may stop you from using our\nGame. If we think it is necessary, we might even have to ask our\nlawyers to get in touch.\n\n[info] Be kind, rewind.\n\nIf you buy, download, use or play our Game, you are agreeing to stick\nto the rules of these end user licence terms. If you don‘t want to or\ncan‘t agree to these rules, then you must not buy, download, use or\nplay our Game.\n\nONE MAJOR RULE\n\nThe one major rule is that you must not distribute anything we‘ve\nmade. By “distribute anything we‘ve made” what we mean is “give copies\nof the game away, make commercial use of, try to make money from, or\nlet other people get access to our game and its parts in a way that is\nunfair or unreasonable”. So the one major rule is that (unless we\nspecifically agree it – such as in brand and asset usage guidelines)\nyou must not:\n\n* give copies our Game to anyone else;\n* make commercial use of anything we‘ve made;\n* try to make money from anything we‘ve made; or\n* let other people get access to anything we‘ve made in a way that is\nunfair or unreasonable.\n* …and so that we are crystal clear, what we have made includes, but\nis not limited to, the client or the server software for our Game. It\nalso includes modified versions of a Game, part of it or anything else\nwe‘ve made.\n\nOtherwise we are quite relaxed about what you do - in fact we really\nencourage you to do cool stuff - but just don‘t do those things that\nwe say you can‘t.\n\n[good] Mod the games.\n[bad] don't sell your mods.\n\n[author's commentary: Does this include the translators for Minecraft\nwhich handle mangling the protocol? There's several which have\ncommercial versions or cripple you if you don't buy]\n\nUSING OUR GAME\n\nYou have bought the game so you can use it, yourself, on your computer.\n\nBelow we also give you limited rights to do other things but we have\nto draw a line somewhere or else people will go too far. If you wish\nto make something pertaining to anything we‘ve made we‘re humbled, but\nplease make sure that it can‘t be interpreted as being official and\nthat it complies with this EULA and the brand and asset usage\nguidelines and above all do not make commercial use of anything we‘ve\nmade.\n\n[info] Don't make things look too official -- Its not theirs.\n\nThe permission we give you to use and play our Game can be revoked if\nyou break the terms of this EULA.\n\nWhen you buy our Game, we give you permission to install the Game on\nyour own personal computer and use and play it on that computer as set\nout in this EULA. This permission is personal to you, so you are not\nallowed to distribute the Game (or any part of it) to anyone else.\nThis also means you cannot sell or rent the Game, or make it available\nfor access to other people and you cannot pass on or resell any\nlicence keys. You may however give gift codes that have been bought\nthrough our official gift code system. This is important to help us\nstop piracy and fraud and to protect our Game. It is also important to\nprevent members of our community from buying pirated versions of our\nGame or fraudulent licence keys – which we may cancel, such as in the\ncase of fraud.\n\nYou are also allowed to adapt our Game for your own personal\n(non-commercial) use, but you must not distribute your adaptations in\nany way that is unfair or adversely affects our rights in the Game.\nAmongst other things, that means that you can‘t just rip-off our\nassets or try to make money out of them. Beyond that, you are not\nbasically allowed to copy, reverse engineer or decompile our Game.\n\n[info] Again, mod Mod and mod some more, just don't sell it.\n\nWithin reason you‘re free to do whatever you want with screenshots and\nvideos of the Game. By “within reason” we mean that you can‘t make any\ncommercial use of them or do things that are unfair or adversely\naffect our rights. If you upload videos of the game to video sharing\nand streaming sites you are however allowed to put ads on them. Also,\ndon‘t just rip art resources and pass them around, that‘s no fun.\n\n[Author's commentary: Doesn't this apply to things like TechCrunch,\nwho use screencaps all day long? ]\n\nEssentially the simple rule is do not make commercial use of anything\nwe‘ve made unless specifically agreed by us, either in our brand and\nasset usage guidelines or under this EULA. Oh and if the law expressly\nallows it, such as under a “fair use” or fair dealing” doctrine then\nthat‘s ok too – but only to the extent that the law says so.\n\n[Author's commentary: that clears it up. Confusing, but not entirely\nunreasonable]\n\nIn order to ensure the integrity of the Game, we need all Game\ndownloads to come from a single central source: us. It‘s also\nimportant for us that 3rd party tools/services don‘t seem “too\nofficial” as we can‘t guarantee their quality. Make sure that you read\nthrough our brand and asset usage guidelines too.\n\n[info] Don't say or act like your mod is endorsed by Mojang.\n\nOWNERSHIP OF OUR GAME AND OTHER THINGS\n\nAlthough we give you permission to play our Game, we are still the\nowners of it. We are also the owners of our brands and any content\ncontained in the Game. Therefore, when you pay for our Game, you are\nbuying a permission to play / use our Game in accordance with this\nEULA - you are not buying the Game itself. The only permissions you\nhave in connection with the Game are the permissions set out in this\nEULA.\n\nAny tools you write for the Game from scratch belong to you. Plugins\nfor the Game also belong to you and you can do whatever you want with\nthem, as long as you don‘t sell them for money / try to make money\nfrom them. We have the final say on what constitutes a tool/plugin and\nwhat doesn‘t.\n\n[bad] They provide the game as a service. Its not yours.\n[good] Mod it!\n[info] Just don't do it for money\n\n[Author's note: This is a constant, repeating thing in this TOS.]\n\nCONTENT\n\n[Author's note: This is almost identical to the previous note on content]\n\nIf you make any content available on or through our Game, you must\ngive us permission to use, copy, modify and adapt that content. This\npermission must be irrevocable, and you must also let us permit other\npeople to use, copy, modify and adapt your content. If you don‘t want\nto give us this permission, do not make content available on or\nthrough our Game. Please think carefully before you make any content\navailable, because it will be made public and might even be used by\nother people in a way you don‘t like.\n\n[bad] What you make belongs to Mojang if you put it on their system.\n\nIf you are going to make something available on or through our Game,\nit must not be offensive to people or illegal, it must be honest, and\nit must be your own creation. The types of things you must not make\navailable using our Game include: posts that include racist or\nhomophobic language; posts that are bullying or trolling; posts that\nmight damage our or another person‘s reputation; posts that include\nporn, advertising or someone else‘s creation or image; or posts that\nimpersonate a moderator or try to trick or exploit people.\n\n[good] Play nice. No really, PLAY NICE.\n[info] Or else.\n\nAny content you make available on our Game must also be your creation.\nYou must not make any content available, using the Game, that\ninfringes the rights of anyone else. If you post content on our Game,\nand we get challenged, threatened or sued by someone because the\ncontent infringes that persons rights, we may hold you responsible and\nthat means you may have to pay us back for any damage we suffer as a\nresult. Therefore it is really important that you only make content\navailable that you have created and you don‘t do so with any content\ncreated by anyone else.\n\n[info] Don't rip other people's stuff. That's mean.\n\nPlease watch out if you are talking to people in our Game. It is hard\nfor either you or us to know for sure that what people say is true, or\neven if people are really who they say they are. You should think\ntwice about giving out information about yourself.\n\nUPGRADES\n\nWe might make upgrades and updates available from time to time, but we\ndon‘t have to. We are also not obliged to provide ongoing support or\nmaintenance of any Game. Of course, we hope to continue to release new\nupdates for our Game, we just can‘t guarantee that we will do so.\n\n[good] We'll do our best to update things\n[bad] We don't have to keep updating our things.\n\nOUR LIABILITY\n\nWhen you get a copy of our Game, we provide it ‘as is‘. Updates and\nupgrades are also provided ‘as is‘. This means that we are not making\nany promises to you about the standard or quality of our Game or that\nour Game will be uninterrupted or error free or for any loss or damage\nthat they cause. We only promise to provide the Game and any services\nwith reasonable skill and care and even then you have to accept that\nwe may release games well before they are complete and so they may\n(and often will) have bugs – but that‘s a price you pay for getting\nthem so early. The law in most countries says that we can‘t disclaim\nliability for death or personal injury caused by our negligence so if\nyour computer gets up and stabs you because of something we‘ve done\nwrong then we‘ll take the hit on that.\n\n[good] if its their fault, they'll take the fall.\n[info] Bugs happen.\n\nTERMINATION\n\nIf we want we can terminate this EULA if you breach the terms. You can\nterminate it too, at any time, all you have to do is uninstall the\nGame from your computer and the EULA will be terminated. If the EULA\nis terminated, you will no longer be allowed to play our Game. The\nparagraphs about \"Ownership of Our Game”, “Our Liability” and “General\nStuff” will continue to apply even after the EULA is terminated.\n\n[ugly] you can disagree with the TOS, but it gets murky afterwards.\n\nGENERAL STUFF\n\nThe EULA is subject to any legal rights you might have. Nothing in\nthese terms and conditions will limit any of your rights that may not\nbe excluded under law nor shall it exclude or limit our liability for\ndeath or personal injury resulting from our negligence nor any\nfraudulent representation.\n\nWe may also change this EULA from time to time but those changes will\nonly be effective to the extent that they can legally apply. For\nexample if you only use the Game in single player mode and don‘t use\nthe updates we make available then the old EULA applies but if you do\nuse the updates or use parts of the game that rely on our providing\nongoing online services then the new EULA will apply. In that case we\nmay not be able to / don‘t need to tell you about the changes for them\nto have effect so you should check back here from time to time so you\nare aware of any changes to the EULA. We‘re not going to be unfair\nabout this though - but sometimes the law changes or someone does\nsomething that affects other users of the Game and we therefore need\nto put a lid on it.\n\nIf you come to us with a suggestion for any one of our Games, that\nsuggestion is made for free. This means we can use your suggestion in\nany way we want and we don‘t have to pay you for it. If you think you\nhave a suggestion that we would be willing to pay you for, you must\ntell us you expect to be paid before you tell us the suggestion.\n\nGUIDELINES FOR THE NAME, BRAND AND ASSETS OF ANY OF OUR GAMES\n\nAll of our games are really important to us and to our community,\nwhich means that lots of you want to use the our Brands and the things\naround our games to do cool stuff. We‘re happy about that. Sometimes,\nhowever, people go too far and do things that make the community think\nthat their products and services are connected with or endorsed by us\nor even produced by us. We are not happy about that. Especially when\npeople do it deliberately to take unfair advantage of the community\nand our work in that way. When that happens, fans buy things thinking\nthey are official which they are not. That means we can't control\nquality etc. which diminishes the value of the work we have done and\nthe trust that our community have in what we do.\n\nWe don‘t want you to stop doing the cool stuff that you do and so\nthese Guidelines are intended to help everyone understand what we\nconsider to be fair and unfair use of our “Brands” and “Assets”. We've\nhad some help from some lawyers and they will also help us if we need\nto take further steps to protect our rights but the purpose of these\n“Guidelines” is to give some clarity on what you can do without having\nto contact us (or our lawyers) - and what you mustn‘t do or else we\n(or our lawyers) will have to contact you. We hope you understand.\n\nGUIDELINES\n\nThese Guidelines cover the use of our Brands and our Assets. For these\npurposes, therefore when we refer to:\n * a Name what we mean is the name of any one of our games as well as\nany names which are confusingly similar to the names of any of our\ngames;\n * our Brands what we mean is any Names and the related logos and\ndistinctive characteristics of any of our games;\n * our Assets what we mean is the code, software, graphics, textures,\nsound and audio from any of our games and any videos or screenshots\ntaken from or our games.\n\nThese Guidelines apply in addition to and not in place of our Terms of\nUse or EULAs. Please remember that we say in all of our EULA that we\nhave one major rule about our games and that is: Do not distribute\nanything we've made – which means don‘t\n * give copies of our games to anyone else;\n * make commercial use of anything we've made;\n * try to make money from anything we've made; or\n * let other people get access to anything we‘ve made in a way that is\nunfair or unreasonable;\n * unless we specifically agree to it or allow it under these Guidelines.\n\nThese Guidelines do not change that principle but are intended to help\npeople understand what we expect and want.\nIf something isn‘t covered by these Guidelines that probably means we\ndon‘t want you to do it. In any case if it isn‘t covered please don‘t\ndo it without getting permission from us. You can contact us at brands\nat mojang.com. If something is specifically covered and permitted by\nthese Guidelines, our Terms of Use or EULAs applicable to any of our\ngames then you don‘t need to contact us.\nPlease also check back here from time to time because we will update\nthese guidelines and provide further guidance.\n\nESSENTIAL REQUIREMENTS\n\nThe first thing to say is that there are the following Essential\nRequirements that apply to all use of the our Brands (which include\nany Names) and our Assets. If you are allowed to use any part of any\nName, any of our Brands and / or any of our Assets then what you are\ndoing MUST:\n * NOT make people think that you or what your are doing is official;\napproved or endorsed by us; or associated or connected with us;\n * NOT be unlawful, deceptive, obscene, harmful or disparaging;\n * NOT adversely affect any of our Brands or any of our Assets;\n * NOT include anything else around it that makes people think that\nyou or what your are doing is official; approved or endorsed by us; or\nassociated or connected with us;\ncomply with the relevant Terms of Use/EULA;\n * sufficiently differentiate the use of any Name you are using from\nany other branding;\n\nThese are the \"Essential Requirements\".\n\n[good] Use the brand within guidelines and they don't care.\n\nWHAT YOU CAN DO\n\nNon-Commercial Things\n\nWe are very relaxed about things you do for yourself. Pretty much\nanything goes there - so go for it and have fun just don‘t distribute\nanything we've made etc.\n\nWe are also quite relaxed about other non-commercial things so feel\nfree to create and share videos, screen shots, independently created\nmods (that don't use any of our Assets), fan art, machinima etc;\n\nHowever if you want to use any Name in the title of a product that you\ndistribute or service that you provide (even if it is for free) then\nyou have to:\nfollow the Essential Requirements;\n * do so in a way that honestly and fairly describes those things or\nthe purpose of them; and\n * ensure that the Name (which includes any confusingly similar name)\nis not the first word and don‘t use any other aspect of any of our\nBrands or Assets as part of any related branding, including as or as\npart of any logo.\n\nThis applies especially if you want to set up and run blogs, servers,\ncommunity forums, fan sites, fan clubs, news groups, events and\ngatherings.\n\n[good] Non-commercial usage of brand is encouraged with rules.\n\nCommercial Things\n\nWe are less relaxed about commercial things. You may not therefore use\nany Names in or as the main name or title of commercial things.\n\nYou may use a Name as a secondary name or title if you:\n * do so because it is necessary to honestly and fairly describe those\nthings or the purpose of them:\n * follow the Essential Requirements;\n * ensure that the Name (which includes any confusingly similar name)\nis not the dominant element or the distinctive part of the complete\nname or title of what you are doing;\n * don‘t use any other aspect of any of our Brands or Assets as part\nof any related branding, including as or as part of any logo.\n\nTo help you we‘ve suggested the following examples:\n\n* \"The Shaft – a Minecraft podcast\" (we‘re cool with that).\n* \"Minecraft - the ultimate help app\" (we‘re NOT cool with that)\n\nYou may not make any other commercial use of any of our Brands or\nAssets for example you may not sell any merchandise that uses any of\nour Brands or Assets and you definitely may not use our Names as\nkeywords or search tags for products that have no relationship with\nthem.\nWe love the idea of people doing cool things with our games and\nsharing those things with the community. That's something we totally\nsupport and encourage. So please feel free to do so but please also\nmake sure you don‘t go too far.\n\n[info] Don't claim to be endorsed by Mojang.\n[good] you can use the name/brand if you need to, e.g. in the title of\na podcast.\n\nIn addition to the Brand Guidelines above we also have the following\nAsset Usage Guidelines that are intended to help you and everyone else\nunderstand what we consider to be fair and unfair – what you can and\ncannot do.\n\n[good] Guidelines for brand usage.\n\nCommerical Usage Guidelines\n\nThe One Major Rule still applies but we may make some exceptions and\nthey will be listed here, in this policy.\nIn this policy we will also give some additional specifics of what you\nmay not do. However if something is not mentioned here it involves\nmaking money using anything from Minecraft (or anything else we've\nmade) please do not do it.\nIn addition to the specifics set out below, where we do allow you to\ndo something you will always need to add a credit as follows:\n\nMinecraft ®/TM & © 2009-2012 Mojang / Notch\n\n[info] You have to mark stuff from Mojang if you use it commercially.\n\nVideos and Screenshots\n\nYou may create, use and distribute videos of you playing or using our\nGame for any lawful reason provided that you don't make any money from\nthem.\n\nYou may make money using your videos of our Game so as long as you\nalso add your own unique content to the video, such as audio\ncommentary. The amount you add must also be enough to make it fair and\nworthwhile for someone to pay for it or for you to make money from it.\nFor example you couldn‘t just include your logo, web address or indent\nbut you could add an audio commentary or your own music if you are\ncreating a music video.\n\nYou may also make money using videos and screen-shots if it is covered\nby so called “fair dealing” or “fair use” exceptions to copyright,\nsuch as where it is for criticism and review, reporting current\naffairs etc. In each case, you will still need to add appropriate\nadditional content and credits where applicable.\n\n…more will follow as and when we decide what to add - so feel free to\nmake requests – and If you are unsure about anything you may or may\nnot do, don't do it unless you get an OK from us first.\n\nPRIVACY POLICY\n\nIt is important to us that your privacy and data are protected. Most\nimportantly we want you to know that we don't want to use your data\nunless you are ok with it. That‘s why we have made this privacy policy\n- so you can be clear on how we intend to use your data.\n\n[good] Its your information, they want to make sure you're OK with that.\n\nThis privacy policy forms a part of the terms of use of any of our\nwebsites (“Terms of Use”) and the end user licence agreement of our\ngames (“EULAs”). When you agree to our Terms of Use or EULAs you are\nalso agreeing to this privacy policy, so it is important that you read\nit carefully. Agreeing with this privacy policy is a condition of the\nTerms of Use and EULA. This means, therefore, that if you don't agree\nwith our privacy policy, you may not be able to play our games or use\nfeatures in them and you may not be able to use our websites or parts\nof them. Sorry about that but we have taken this approach because\nthere are a lot of people playing our games and using our site and it\nwould be very difficult for us keep track of who does and who doesn't\nagree to us using their data. We also depend on this data to enable us\nto continue to develop our games and websites in an efficient way.

Through this clause, user 1 would be responsible for the behavior of user 2, and moreover, if the copyright owner decides to sue Mega (which they shouldn't, they should probably only sue user 2 and send a removal request to the forum), then user 1 has to pay for the legal fees of Mega.\n\nthis means that through no fault of their own, user 1 could suddenly have to pay a lot of money to Mega.\n\nYou may hope that this clause never comes into effect, but that is only hope. the truth is that as a Mega user you are agreeing that you may have to pay a lot of money to Mega, even if you were not the person who got them into trouble.\n\nwhat do other people think of this? i think this clause is really quite heavy, and goes a lot further than the more standard 'you will indemnify us if you broke these terms' clause that many other services have.\n\n-- \ntosdr.org | twitter.com/tosdr | github.com/tosdr\n--- You received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups \"Terms of Service; Didn't Read\" group.\nTo unsubscribe from this group and stop receiving emails from it, send an email to tosdr+unsubscribe@googlegroups.com.\nTo post to this group, send email to tosdr@googlegroups.com.\nVisit this group at http://groups.google.com/group/tosdr?hl=en.\nFor more options, visit https://groups.google.com/groups/opt_out.\n\n\n"},

For all other devices, the prorated ETF is calculated by \ntaking the months remaining times $10 with a maximum of $200 and minimum of \n$50.\"\n\n*Info - There are activation fees and sometimes deposits*\n\"Up to a $36 activation fee applies to new activations, certain service \nplan changes or upgrades of phones or devices. A reconnect fee of up to $36 \nmay apply to reestablish service on all accounts that have \nbeen disconnected for nonpayment or discontinuous of service. A deposit, in \nmost instances between $50 and $750 (but sometimes up to $1000), may be \nrequired per line to establish service.\"\n\n*Bad - User may be on the hook for a stolen phone*\n\"Call us immediately if your Device is lost or stolen because you may be \nresponsible for usage charges before you notify us of the alleged loss or \ntheft. A lost or stolen Device does not reduce or remove your Term \nCommitment. You will remain liable for any monthly recurring charges \nassociated with the Service on your Device after you notify us of the \nalleged loss or theft. You agree to cooperate if we choose to investigate \nthe matter (provide facts, sworn statements, etc.). We may not waive any \nEarly Termination Fees if you choose to terminate Services as a result of \nloss or theft of your Device.\"\n\n*Good - Can leave contract if terms change*\n\"We may change any part of the Agreement at any time, including, but not \nlimited to, rates, charges, how we calculate charges, discounts, coverage, \ntechnologies used to provide services, or your terms of Service. We will \nprovide you notice of material changes—and we may provide you notice of \nnon-material changes—in a manner consistent with this Agreement (see \n\"Providing Notice To Each Other Under The Agreement\" section). If a change \nwe make to the Agreement is material and has a material adverse effect on \nServices under your Term Commitment, you may terminate each line of Service \nmaterially affected without incurring an Early Termination Fee only if you: \n(a) call us within 30 days after the effective date of the change; and (b) \nspecifically advise us that you wish to cancel Services because of a \nmaterial change to the Agreement that we have made. If you do not cancel \nService within 30 days of the change, an Early Termination Fee will apply \nif you terminate Services before the end of any applicable Term Commitment.\"\n\n*Alert - Service can be ended at any time*\n\"We can, without notice, suspend or terminate any Service at any time for \nany reason. For example, we can suspend or terminate any Service for the \nfollowing: (a) late payment; (b) exceeding an Account Spending Limit; (c) \nharassing/threatening/abusing/offending our employees or agents; (d) \nproviding false or inaccurate information; (e) interfering with our \noperations; (f) using/suspicion of using Services in any manner restricted \nby or inconsistent with the Agreement and Policies; (g) breaching, failing \nto follow, or abusing the Agreement or Policies; (h) providing false, \ninaccurate, dated, or unverifiable identification or credit information or \nbecoming insolvent or bankrupt; (i) modifying a Device from its \nmanufacturer specifications (for example, rooting the device); (j) failing \nto use our Services for an extended period of time; (k) failing to maintain \nan active Device in connection with our Services; or (l) if we believe the \naction protects our interests, any customer's interests, or our networks.\"\n\n*Bad - Entered into mandatory arbitration *\n\"We each agree to arbitrate all Disputes between us, on an individual \nbasis, not on a class-wide or consolidated basis. This agreement to \narbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted. In arbitration, there's no \njudge or jury. However, just as a court would, the arbitrator must honor \nthe terms and limitations in the Agreement and can award damages and \nrelief, including any attorneys' fees authorized by law. The arbitrator's \ndecision and award is final and binding, with some exceptions under the \nFederal Arbitration Act (\"FAA\"), and judgment on the award may be entered \nin any court with jurisdiction.\"\n\n\"No Class Actions\nTO THE EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW, WE EACH WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO PURSUE DISPUTES ON \nA CLASSWIDE BASIS; THAT IS, TO EITHER JOIN A CLAIM WITH THE CLAIM OF ANY \nOTHER PERSON OR ENTITY OR ASSERT A CLAIM IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY ON \nBEHALF OF ANYONE ELSE IN ANY LAWSUIT, ARBITRATION, OR OTHER PROCEEDING.\"\n\"No Trial By Jury\nTO THE EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW, WE EACH WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN \nANY LAWSUIT, ARBITRATION, OR OTHER PROCEEDING.\"\n\n-- \nwww.tos-dr.info // www.twitter.com/tosdr // www.github.com/Unhosted/ToS-DR\n--- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups \"Terms of Service; Didn't Read\" group.\nTo post to this group, send email to tosdr@googlegroups.com.\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send email to tosdr+unsubscribe@googlegroups.com.\nVisit this group at http://groups.google.com/group/tosdr?hl=en.\nFor more options, visit https://groups.google.com/groups/opt_out.\n\n\n"},

{"thread":"tmXfQIGPTvs","threadEntry":"M71QpjARKmQJ","filename":"./src/posts/1339771831.21271.17.camel@synclavier.lan.json","contents":"To continue on the thread about copyright licenses\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/tosdr/kizrN7qb1Ck\n(please answer to that post if you have further opinion about the\ngeneral topic)\n\nLet's now focus on Twitter terms. https://twitter.com/tos\n\nTL;DR: \n     1. [mediocre] Ownership: The copyright license is very broad and\n        goes beyond the requirements to run the service,\n     2. [mediocre] Third-parties: Your data can be shared with Twitter's\n        partners and other third-parties, on Twitter's terms – not\n        yours.\n\nThe copyright license in Twitter terms is, as I wrote earlier, very\nbroad:\n        You retain your rights to any Content you submit, post or\n        display on or through the Services. By submitting, posting or\n        displaying Content on or through the Services, you grant us a\n        worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license (with the right\n        to sublicense) to use, copy, reproduce, process, adapt, modify,\n        publish, transmit, display and distribute such Content in any\n        and all media or distribution methods (now known or later\n        developed).\n        \n        [Tip This license is you authorizing us to make your Tweets\n        available to the rest of the world and to let others do the\n        same.]\n        \nThat seems reasonable, but is it? The \"Tip\" is very optimistic. The\nlicense isn't just about the rights \"to display to the world\" but is\nindeed much larger.\n\nI would say that the most worrying aspect of this license is that there\nare absolutely no limitations to this license. By limitations, I mean\nsomething like SeenThis (Twitter competitor) \"autorisations permettant\nle bon fonctionnement du système\" or Dropbox's \"These Terms do not grant\nus any rights to your stuff or intellectual property except for the\nlimited rights that are needed to run the Services\". Dropbox also\ndocuments in their privacy policy why exactly and with whom information\nis shared.\n\nMoreover if you look at how Twitter handled copyright prior to their\nSeptember 2009 changes, you get a very different picture. Here's what we\nhad before:\n        Copyright (What’s Yours is Yours)\n        \n            We claim no intellectual property rights over the material\n        you provide to the Twitter service. Your profile and materials\n        uploaded remain yours. [...]\n            We encourage users to contribute their creations to the\n        public domain or consider progressive licensing terms.\n        \nI believe it's possible that this former policy may encounter problems.\nHowever I am not convinced that the current solution is in the best\ninterest of the users. With such a broad scope in the copyright license,\nTwitter effectively becomes owner of the data (tweet, meta information\nin the tweet, pictures tweeted; etc.) and can transfer or sublicense to\nthird parties. As acknowledges the current TOS:\n        \n        You agree that this license includes the right for Twitter to\n        provide, promote, and improve the Services and to make Content\n        submitted to or through the Services available to other\n        companies, organizations or individuals who partner with Twitter\n        for the syndication, broadcast, distribution or publication of\n        such Content on other media and services, subject to our terms\n        and conditions for such Content use.\n        \n        [Tip Twitter has an evolving set of rules for how ecosystem\n        partners can interact with your Content. These rules exist to\n        enable an open ecosystem with your rights in mind. But what’s\n        yours is yours – you own your Content (and your photos are part\n        of that Content).]\n\nTo me, what's in the best interest of the user is a copyright license\nchosen by the user, like for instance CC-BY or CC-BY-SA or CC-BY-NC or\nCC-BY-ND, whatever the _user_ chooses. At least in these case it is\nclear for users how their content is licensed.\n-- \nHugo Roy \n  French Coordinator, FSFE       chat: hugo@jabber.fsfe.org\n  www.fsfe.org/about/roy         mobile: +336 08 74 13 41\n                                 mobile DE: +49 151 143 56 563\n\n-- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups \"Terms of Service; Didn't Read\" group.\nTo post to this group, send email to tosdr@googlegroups.com.\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send email to tosdr+unsubscribe@googlegroups.com.\nFor more options, visit this group at http://groups.google.com/group/tosdr?hl=en.\n\n"},

While, in itself, it is not a \ngame, it hosts several, and provides services for freeform RP. The required \nreading before joining is in three documents, all available from the bottom \nof every page.\nToS: http://www.f-list.net/doc/tos.php\nPrivacy Policy: http://www.f-list.net/doc/privacy.php\nRules: http://wiki.f-list.net/index.php/Rules\n\n*PLEASE BE WARNED: THIS SITE IS NSFW.* (but the ToS and Privacy Policy do \nnot have any NSFW content on them)\n\nI'm using the following to indicate my opinions on the terms:\nI: information\nG: Good!\n~: Mediocre\nX: Alert\n?: I have no idea what to compare this to\n\n\n*Services requiring registration:*\n\n   - [~]Changing Terms: The terms can be changed at any time, with no \n   notice. \"We expressly reserve the right to change these Terms of Use from \n   time to time without notice to you. You acknowledge and agree that it is \n   your responsibility to review this site and these Terms of Use from time to \n   time and to familiarize yourself with any modifications.\"\n   - [~]Suspension and Censorship: Due to the adult nature of the site, \n   accounts can be banned if they belong to an underage individual. The usual \n   provisions barring harassment, impersonation, piracy, spamming, and hacking \n   the site also apply. Accounts can be banned without notice to the owner.\n   - [~]Right to leave: While accounts can be 'deleted' (stated in the \n   ToS), this does not actually purge associated character profiles from the \n   database, but only renders them unviewable (not stated in the ToS, but \n   discussed in the suggestions forum). If you intend to leave, I would \n   suggest that you delete your characters first, and then the account. It's a \n   few steps, but it's definitely possible. It is also possible to open a \n   ticket and request the account and its associated characters be deleted. (I \n   have reasons to believe this discrepancy in policy vs reality is due to bad \n   code, rather than ill intent.)\n   - [G]Personal Data: The only personal data required to make an account \n   is an email address, which is never made public. Other contact information \n   (IM names, usernames from popular MMOs) can be made available on character \n   profiles, and can be removed just as easily.\n   - [I]Sharing RL Info: Aside from other digital methods of communication, \n   sharing personal information is prohibited. No personally identifiable \n   information may be shared, nor may RL meetups be arranged.\n   - [~]Third Parties: \"We will not share -any- of your data with third \n   parties without your permission.\" BUT \"You also grant us the right to \n   disclose to third parties certain Registration Data about you.\" \n   Registration data consists entirely of a username, password, and email \n   address. No other information is collected, nor has any evidence, even \n   anecdotally, arisen of the second statement coming to pass.\n   - [?] Law and government requests: In short, if it's public, it's \n   public. But, if it's not, you need a warrant. \"We will not inspect or \n   disclose the contents of private Communications except with the consent of \n   the sender or the recipient, or in the narrowly-defined situations provided \n   under the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, or as other required by \n   law or by court or governmental order.\"\n   - [I]Age requirement: 18 years of age, or legal majority in your area, \n   if higher.\n   - [G]API Access: \"F-List does share some profile data (excluding contact \n   details) with other sites that may want to offer services like embeddable \n   profiles, and stuff like that. If you don't want this, turn API access off \n   in settings, and any access to your profiles is blocked.\"\n   - [I]Shared Accounts: ...are prohibited. One account, one user.\n   - [I]Multiple Accounts: ... are permitted, provided one is not using \n   them to evade a ban.\n\n\n*Services with user generated content:*\n\n   - [?]Scope of the copyright license: \"Subject to our Privacy Policy, any \n   communication or material that you transmit to this site or to us, whether \n   by electronic mail, post, or other means, for any reason, will be treated \n   as non-confidential and non-proprietary. While you retain all rights in \n   such communications or material, you grant us and our agents and affiliates \n   a non-exclusive, paid-up, perpetual, and worldwide right to copy, \n   distribute, display, perform, publish, translate, adapt, modify, and \n   otherwise use such material for any purpose regardless of the form or \n   medium (now known or not currently known) in which it is used.\"\n   - [?]Ownership: User retains all rights, but grants the site a \n   \"non-exclusive, paid-up, perpetual, and worldwide right to copy, \n   distribute, display, perform, publish, translate, adapt, modify, and \n   otherwise use such material for any purpose regardless of the form or \n   medium (now known or not currently known) in which it is used.\"\n   - [~]Copyrighted material removal requests: Upon receiving a properly \n   filed DMCA request, sent to the correct address, the offending material \n   will be removed, pending adjucation. (There is a list with eight bullet \n   points on the information that must be included in the request.) \"You \n   acknowledge and agree that upon receipt of a notice of a claim of copyright \n   infringement, we may immediately remove the identified materials from our \n   site without liability to you or any other party and that the claims of the \n   complaining party and the party that originally posted the materials will \n   be referred to the United States Copyright Office for adjudication as \n   provided in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.\"\n\n\n*Additional common topics to watch for:*\n\n   - [G]Anonymity and Tracking: No data is stored longer than one day. \n   \"While we do collect data of site usage, both for statistical and for \n   security purposes (Pretty much all raw $_POST/$_GET data if you know what \n   this means) This info is deleted after one day. We don't store any data \n   like this for longer than a day. A cronjob is ran twice every day that \n   deletes data that is older than a day.\"\n   - [I]Cookies: Site uses cookies for logins and to store user preferences \n   for the web-based chat client. Deleting the cookies logs out the user and \n   resets the client defaults.\n   - [I]Jurisdiction and Governing Laws: State of Texas, US. \"Each of us \n   agrees and hereby submits to the exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue \n   any court of competent jurisdiction within the State of Texas with respect \n   to such matters.\"\n\n-- \nwww.tos-dr.info // www.twitter.com/tosdr // www.github.com/Unhosted/ToS-DR\n--- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups \"Terms of Service; Didn't Read\" group.\nTo post to this group, send email to tosdr@googlegroups.com.\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send email to tosdr+unsubscribe@googlegroups.com.\nVisit this group at http://groups.google.com/group/tosdr?hl=en.\nFor more options, visit https://groups.google.com/groups/opt_out.\n\n\n"},

Clearly indicating the\ninevitability  that the digital tracking will creep into the physical\nspaces. It is no surprise the Facebook is pushing this envelope.\n\nA quote from the article \"Datalogix (a data matching company) gets its\ninformation from retailers like grocery stores and drug stores who\nkeep careful records of what its customers who use its loyalty\ndiscount programs are buying.\"\n\nThen, with the Facebook partnership, Datalogix is able to match your\nFacebook profile with drug store purchases..\n\nHere is the article.\n\nhttp://www.theatlanticwire.com/technology/2012/09/facebook-tracking-you-drug-store-now-too/57183/\n\nI think it is critically important that informed consent is acquired\nat the point of purchase (in the physical world) to share this\ninformation with a third party like Facebook.  This informed consent\nrequirement is extremely important especially for physical world\nintegration of digital information.  Perhaps this is something as a\ngroup we could advocate?\n\nBest Regards\n\n- Mark\n\n--\nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the Google\nGroups \"open notice\" group.\nTo post to this group, send email to opennotice@googlegroups.com.\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send email to\nopennotice+unsubscribe@googlegroups.com.\nFor more options, visit https://groups.google.com/groups/opt_out.\n"},

They agree to something with a third party, then the third party has a right to my data, and OnLive provides?\n\n>     * To process your entries and participation in sweepstakes, contests, promotions, tournaments or other events if any, in which you choose to participate.\n\nAgain, it is unclear *which* (personal) information is used and how. Sure I can not participate in sweeptstakes, contests or promotions. But tournaments are normally not such a problematic thing.\n\n>     *To enable the social networking features of the OnLive Websites and OnLive Game Service.\n\nWhat ever that does I guess!?\nOnLive may share your Personal Information with an unaffiliated third party under the following circumstances:\n\n>     OnLive expressly reserves the right to disclose Personal Information and any other information to third parties if we believe, in good faith, that we are required to do so by applicable law\n\nI never liked this statement. It allows them to just throw the data out when they are asked by any government, law or similar organisation once they ask for it. What would be appropriate is to only hand it out once a court ruling is presented.\n\n>     We may also disclose Personal Information and any other information where necessary for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims or as otherwise permitted by law.\n\nHoly shit, so they do throw my data out to just any flawed corporate claiming whatever.\n\n>     OnLive reserves the right to disclose to a third party the Personal Information or any other information of a user who we believe is in violation of any policy or rule as posted on the Websites and Services, even without a subpoena, warrant, court order or other governmental request.\n\n-- \ntosdr.org | twitter.com/tosdr | github.com/tosdr\n--- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups \"Terms of Service; Didn't Read\" group.\nTo unsubscribe from this group and stop receiving emails from it, send an email to tosdr+unsubscribe@googlegroups.com.\nTo post to this group, send email to tosdr@googlegroups.com.\nVisit this group at http://groups.google.com/group/tosdr.\nFor more options, visit https://groups.google.com/groups/opt_out.\n"},
